  <p>
  In 1976, I made a family album and updated family trees, and gave them to my family for Christmas. Dad said,
  </p>

  <blockquote>"That all led to getting a bit of family history down in words and it seemed that I was the goat. Besides dates and places and events, I seem to wander into details of other things, but some may be of interest to a few who take time to struggle through it."</blockquote>

  <p>Here, eight years later, is that family history as written by Dad, with the histories written by his brothers and sisters at the end.</p>

  <p>Dad died in May, 1985, and we all miss him. I consider this history a tribute to his memory and am pleased to present it to you now.</p>

  <h2><a name="i-remember">I Remember</a></h2>
  <p class="byline">by Allan [G.A] Lee</p>
  <h3><a name="i-remember--early-memeories">EARLY MEMORIES</a></h3>

  <p>
    I am told that I was born in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Halma,+MN+56729/@48.6575763,-96.6098196,4195m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x52c12857a7ebfb89:0x65de76daefdd54fd!8m2!3d48.6610887!4d-96.6003205">Halma, Minnesota</a> on Oct 29, 1917. The house was a mile east of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Eidsvold+Lutheran+Church/@48.6610661,-96.6003087,206m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x52c128f78bd29831:0xd740f46ec5c99400!2sEidsvold+Lutheran+Church!3b1!8m2!3d48.6611111!4d-96.6!3m4!1s0x52c128f78bd29831:0xd740f46ec5c99400!8m2!3d48.6611111!4d-96.6">Eidsvold Church</a> and was pointed out to me hundreds of times. When I saw it in 1973, it had been used as a granary, and by then some sheep were running through it. It gave me a funny feeling to realize that a friendly old landmark was disappearing&mdash;because of old age!
  </p>
  <p>
    About the first things I remember clearly were in the first grade at Badger in 1923, where my teacher was a Miss Esther Johnson, and my first girl friend was Irene Satran. With four big sisters to teach me before and during the school year, I had sort of a head start on reading and arithmetic, so was able to stay ahead of most of the other kids in those areas.
  </p>

<p>I don't remember much about the house west of Badger, except
  it was pretty new and must have had a basement with a furnace. I
  seem to remember standing on a big register between the dining
  and living room to soak up heat. How I missed that later when we
  had moved and had to stand close to a pot-bellied stove and keep
  turning around, and going into the kitchen to sit with feet in
  the oven of the range, where a piece of firewood was placed to
  put your heels on. Seems there was also a bannister on the
  stairway that Sylvia and I could slide down.</p>

<p>While living there, I can remember Alfred and Annie, with
  Anton and Walter living two or three miles south west, and Uncle
  Lewis a couple of miles or so straight west. In 1922, after
  Lewis died, Aunt Irene packed up her things plus Ole, Lester and
  Marvin, and took off for Canada, where some of her relatives and
  friends lived. 52 years later, in 1974, Ila and I and Elmer and
  Lil were lucky enough to see Marvin and Ole in Minneota, where
  several cousins (ten) had gathered at Norman and Vera's place. I
  think you all have, or at least have seen copies of the fine snap
  that Gary got that day of the 10 first cousins.</p>

  <p>Newell and the older girls tell of papa buying an old school
  house, tearing it down and using the lumber to build the barn and
  house west of Badger. Willard Olevson, a brother of Aunt Bea,
  was a carpenter and did most of the building. The barn was
  finished first and we lived in that until the house was ready,
  Willard living with us right on the job.</p>

  <p>Newell had gone to the ag college at Crookston for three
  years and was ready to try farming. The deal on the farm had
  included a used Overland towing car and an Emerson tractor and
  breaking plow. (He says the car and tractor were both lemons.)
  The farm was mostly virgin brush covered land, with a small grove
  of poplars here and there. He broke up 40 acres the first
  summer, but had a lot of tractor trouble besides turning up
  hundreds of rocks. Horses were used on a "stone boat", which
  consisted of a sort of crude sled of planks spiked on a couple of
  logs for runners. It was pulled across the field and the rocks

  rolled on it and then deposited in the handiest place, usually
  the middle of the field. I can remember that every field in the
  whole area had its "stone pile", and it would soon turn green
  with the weeds and brush that somehow lived on the soil that
  clung to the stones or grew up through them. The piles also
  harbored lots of small animals&mdash;rodents and snakes.</p>

  <p>The fields were mostly small and irregularly shaped, as an
  occasional grove of large trees was of necessity left standing,
  even if a lot of dynamite was used on stumps in an attempt to get

  them down. And rocks had a way of coming to the surface year
  after year, which meant more trips with the stone boat every
  spring. There were always enough left to raise havoc with the
  horse drawn machinery. I liked to go along with Newell on the

  stone boat, and he even let me drive the horses sometimes, as
  they weren't likely to run away with a load of rocks.</p>

  <p>Newell tells of one little adventure I had at the Badger
  farm. He had a wagon box mounted on a sleigh and had filled it
  with "cobs" of unsplit wood to be put in the basement for use in
  the furnace. With me on top of the load, he had driven up beside
  the house, and after tying the lines, had gone into the basement
  to open the window or trapdoor. I somehow got the lines untied
  and shook them and said "Giddap," and Newell looked out to see
  the sled moving off. Rushing out, he managed to catch up just as
  we went around the corner of the house and scrambled up to get the lines. Then in order to teach the team that they actually
  hadn't run away, he took them as fast as they would go for a long
  run across the snowy fields until they were played out. When I
  got back in the house I told Mama, "Boy, Newell sure gave me a nice fast ride," as I thought it was great. I guess they watched
  me closer after that except on the stone boat, which didn't slide
  very well.</p>

  <p>The four girls had graduated from high school at Badger, and Newell did too, being the first boy to do so there. About that
  time, Alfred's gave up trying to farm the wet, sour, rocky soil
  there and went back to Minneota. Income never caught up with expenses and payments on the Badger farm, so the mortgage was
  foreclosed in 1924 and we moved to Haug.</p>

  <p>The house we moved into at Haug was pink, and the old barn
  there had a shed built on the east side with a slanting tarpaper
  roof and Sylvia and I used to spend hours playing on it. We
  didn't use a ladder, but shinnied up a pole or board to get up.
  Never broke a bone falling off either, although it must have
  scared Mama.</p>

  <p>Siv and I got bikes at an early age and soon learned to ride
  them as most kids do&mdash;by falling a lot. I couldn't reach the
  pedals of my first one when they reached the bottom, so Papa took
  the seat off and cut a section of and old Model T tire and tied
  it on with some twine in its place. I later padded it some more
  with pieces of old quilts and used it that way for quite a time.
  Papa also wired some wooden blocks on the pedals, giving it the effect of having them on edge, but that made them hit the ground
  when leaning into a sharp corner, so that wasn't too good. The
  wheels were always getting bent and got loose spokes that would
  stick through the rim and damage the tire if tightened too much.
  The tires were tubeless and were really just like a piece of
  garden hose made into a circle of the right size with the ends
  stuck together and a valve stem stuck in for the air. A black
  sticky cement was supposed to hold them in place, but a hard
  brake application would make the wheel turn inside of the tire
  and the valve stem would fold up somewhere under it. Then it
  was a real job to get straightened out and keep in place again. Sylvia would also ride on the back fender, so that was soon bent
  out of shape. The coaster brake took the punishment though, and
  never gave any trouble. I remember being really surprised the
  day Papa brought it home (a used one of course) to find out that
  he could ride it, and at first I couldn't believe that it was
  actually for me.</p>

  <p>In the fall of 1924, I went to school at Haug, a two room

  country school. My teacher was Jewell Torkelson, and I passed
  both second and third grade that year as I could already read
  with that group. She was also my fourth grade teacher, and

  Lenora Haug my fifth.</p>

  <p>We had a couple of small horses that Thelma drove on the
  school bus route. Bob was so old and skinny and lazy that he was
  gentle enough for Sylvia and me to ride him anytime. But his
  backbone was like a 2 x 4 on edge and was very hard on our
  bottoms when we were able to coax him into a trot. How we wished
  for a saddle, but of course couldn't afford that and we tried to
  tie on old blankets and quilts, but they wouldn't stay put.
  Blossom's back was fine, but she was younger and full of pep, and
  being blind in one eye was pretty skittish. She wouldn't
  tolerate a couple of small kids on her back who weren't strong
  enough to be her boss, so we had to be content with old Bob.
  Blossom might have even run away with Thelma and the school bus,
  except that she would have had to pull Bob along too.</p>

  <p>Papa had built a small school bus body out of some lumber
  and wallboard, with a tiny windshield and a slot for the lines,
  and a door. I don't think it had a stove in it, but the ones in
  Badger did. Of course we had blankets and quilts and even a
  horse hide that I think came from one of Uncle Alfred's horses,
  and maybe even belonged to him. Mama would have some hot flat
  irons ready, or even plain old heated rocks, and with them under
  the blankets, we kept from freezing on those 30 below mornings.</p>

  <p>I can remember charcoal foot warmers too. They were an oval
  or partly flattened cylinder of sheet metal covered with
  asbestos, a bit over a foot long and about half as wide. They
  had a little drawer in one end that could hold the charcoal and
  it had a tiny damper for draft. The charcoal that I remember
  came pressed into pieces about the size of a brick, and half as
  thick, and when one of these was lit and burning good at one end,
  it was put in the little drawer and would burn for hours, with

  the heat controlled after a fashion by the little damper. Funny
  there weren't a lot of fires or carbon monoxide problems, but I
  guess the wind came through the cracks in the buses and houses
  and provided ventilation.</p>

  <p>Taking a hot flat iron wrapped in a towel along to bed on a
  cold night was a regular thing, and blankets were used instead of

  sheets in the winter. The kitchen was generally the warmest, as
  the old range was kept going, and all the kids were expected to
  keep the woodbox full. There was always a steaming kettle on it

  and some flat irons too, and there was a reservoir on the end
  that held a limited amount of warm water for Saturday night
  baths, which we took standing in a dishpan close to the stove.</p>

  <p>Flat irons were handy things. A person would have at least
  three identical ones on top of the stove to get hot, and then a
  snap on handle was used on one to start ironing and pressing. As
  soon as the damp and mostly starched clothes had cooled it off
  too much, another hot one was used. There was no unhandy cord
  to get tangled up or tripped over, but of course the stove had to
  be hot, even in summer. They were also handy to crack nuts with
  or on, so were really important. We also used them for paper
  weights, holding books open, foot warmers, nut crackers, cracking
  someone's skull (so I've heard), and even ironing clothes.
  We also had a gasoline iron that burned hi-test gas, but I think
  that one was a bit temperamental and wouldn't always work right.
  It had a small round tank on one end that was pressurized by a
  tiny built in pump similar to a bike tire pump, and that sprayed
  the fuel into the little burner inside the iron. Mantle lamps
  and lanterns also had a little pump built into the heavy base
  that held the hi-test, but a grown up was needed to light and
  care for one of these, and the mantles were fragile and wouldn't
  stand hard knocking around. They gave a brilliant light though,
  as the mantles became incandescent when the gas burned inside of
  them. Similar, but improved lanterns with mantles are still
  available to be used for camping, etc.</p>

  <p>For reading, we mostly used a kerosene lamp with a circular
  wick that gave a pretty good yellowish light when the wick was
  kept trimmed. Some kerosene cans had a little pump on top and a
  spout which made it easy to fill the lamps. I liked to work
  that. Smaller lamps, and the lanterns we hung in the barn to do
  the chores by, had straight wicks, and their light was pretty
  feeble and flickering. I guess one of these started the fire
  that burned most of Chicago when Mrs. O'Leary's cow kicked it
  over. Ila's grandfather, Hans Christian Gulbranson, lost all his
  fine carpenter's tools in that fire, and then he came to Alta and
  homesteaded about a mile southwest of the town!</p>

  <p>Mama had a big old "Doctor Book" that she used out of
  necessity, and I often had my throat painted inside with iodine
  on a cotton swab when it was sore. Also Musterole was smeared on
  the outside and a woolen sock pinned around my neck, and that
  really warmed things up. "Analgesic Balm" was also a favorite
  salve or ointment, and we liked horehound candy sticks that we

  sometimes got for a cough. Both of the folks depended to some
  extent on laxatives, at least mineral oil, and whenever we kids
  had any ailment, Mama's first question was, "How are your
  bowels?" Of course we didn't like castor or mineral oil, so she
  made up a paste of ground figs and raisins and prunes that she
  moistened with a little strong senna leaf tea. We didn't mind
  eating a spoonful of that, and the tea made it a pretty potent
  mixture.</p>

  <p>A year or so before I was born, Mama had a miscarriage and
  the bleeding was very bad. Finally, Newell ran to Karlstad along
  the railroad tracks to notify Dr. Turnbull, and he then rode back

  with him in his buggy with his fastest team on it, and the doctor
  finally got it controlled.</p>


  <h3><a name="i-remember--transportation-travel">TRANSPORTATION AND TRAVELS</a></h3>

  <p>I can't remember the dates and sequences of all the
  events,but Aunt Oline came to Haug to visit us once and she was
  very tall and blond and was proud of her hair which reached well
  below her waist, and she could sit on it. When she washed it,
  almost a whole day was spent in the process. It seemed like she
  combed and brushed it for hours! Uncle Ole cranked up his Model
  T and brought all his girls and Bertha from somewhere (probably
  Minneapolis) and cousin Mabel came once from Georgia. Grandma
  Orsen came a couple of times and I can remember her, but none of
  the details, except once I had to sleep with her and didn't like
  it because I thought she smelled so "old." She suffered from
  asthma and hay fever. Of course most traveling was by train,
  with changes here and there to different railways and sometimes a
  wait of several hours for connections. Rich people took sleepers
  and ate in diners, but we carried lunches and slept in the
  coaches and thought nothing of it. Of course, kids can sleep
  anywhere if they're tired, but how Mama could stand some of the
  trips we took to Minneota is another thing.</p>

  <p>The marvelous Model T brought on a lot more traveling and
  the first one we got was a 1925 "touring car". It had 30 x 3-
  inch tires in front and 30 x 3 1/2-inch tires in back and they
  held about 55 pounds of air pressure. They could be pried off
  the rims with a couple of big screwdrivers or "tire irons" that
  came with each car, along with a jack and tire pump and patches
  and a few other cheap tools that were carried in a box along with
  the side curtains. The box was fastened to a running board.
  There was no door on the driver's side, but a small person could
  get in if the side curtains weren't on, by standing on the tool
  box and crawling over the side. The tread width was the same as
  wagons and buggies, so they could go in the same tracks. When
  wider cars were made, the country folks didn't think they would
  sell as they wouldn't quite fit the track. "Balloon" tires also
  met some resistance because they were too wide to fit in the
  tracks or "ruts." No one dreamed that the ruts would disappear
  under wide strips of concrete over which several cars could drive
  side by side at unheard of speeds, with the passengers enclosed

  in glass and steel and riding on foam rubber cushions in air-conditioned comfort.</p>

  <p>In Model T years the roads were mostly ruts in the dirt,
  with grass growing high between them, and the "highways" that
  were graveled soon became like washboards, and jolted things
  apart. The narrow high pressure tires and loose jointed steering
  made it hazardous to meet another, but due to low speed and fewer
  cars there really weren't a lot of fatal accidents. Trees and
  animals and ditches were probably hit more often than other cars.</p>

  <p>Getting stuck in the mud was pretty common in the spring,
  but there was generally a farmer with horses nearby to take care
  of that. Otherwise branches and boards were shoved under the
  wheels. It was also possible to put chains on without jacking
  up the wheels, but it wasn't easy and was always messy. The low
  and reverse bands would wear out too, and I was still pretty
  small when I learned to adjust them. I even put in new ones, but
  that was pretty hard, and one had to be careful not to drop a
  bolt or nut down into the works, as there wasn't room to fish it
  out and the whole assembly was full of very heavy oil. Modern
  automotive transmissions are amazingly similar, but use governors
  and hydraulic pressure to do the work of the pedals. They are
  very efficient and trouble free and generally last for thousands
  of miles, but they occasionally break down. It takes a lot of
  special tools and knowhow to repair one. I don't try.</p>

  <p>The Model T had a flat belt made of canvas, to turn the fan

  blades. They would stretch and the radiator would boil over,
  which it did a lot in hot weather anyhow, as a water pump wasn't
  provided until the last few years they were made. It was hoped

  that the hot water from the engine would just naturally flow to
  the top of the radiator and then be cooled and go down and into
  the engine again to keep things cool enough. Wood alcohol was
  added to the water in the winter sometimes as anti freeze, and
  sometimes even pure kerosene was used. Mostly they were drained
  after use in freezing weather, and hot water was used to fill it
  the next time if it could be started. Jacking up one rear wheel
  would sometimes help, as it was then free to be turned merely by
  the heavy oil on the bands in the transmission that the pedals
  were hooked to. When we got one with a starter, a helper on the
  crank helped the starter get up a bit of speed when it got cold.
  After the snows came, the roads couldn't be used even if one got
  the car started. Cars were usually jacked up and put on blocks
  for about four months to save tires from getting flat spots or
  cracks as the air slowly went out.</p>

  <p>Mama took Sylvia and me along to Minneota two or three times
  during the period we lived at Badger and Haug. We went by train

  with several changes on the way. We got to know all our cousins
  there pretty well, and have kept in touch with them and visited
  occasionally ever since. Uncle Nick's new house on the hill,

  about three miles north of Minneota, had the first real bathtub
  that I can remember using. Getting hot water to it was a problem
  though, and I guess water was scarce at the time. One Saturday

  night Mama gave Sylvia and me a bath, took one herself and then
  saved the water in it for Bea and Tillie and Bernice. Then it
  was the boys' turn, and at last Uncle Nick made the final use of
  the same water! I've never asked Norman if he can remember some
  of those things, but no doubt he does.</p>

  <p>Alfred's lived on the old Orsen farm, south of Nick's maybe

  a mile or so, and a little creek ran through both places. We
  could walk along it to visit.</p>

  <p>It must have been the summer of 1925 that we had our longest

  visit in Minneota. Aunt Mamie had married Walter Miller and
  Maxine was born on October 20, 1923. Donald was born July 27,
  1925, so Maxine was a bit under two, and as Mamie hadn't been too
  strong, Mama went to help and took Sylvia and me along. They

  farmed near Walnut Grove, about 30 miles southeast of Minneota.
  Mamie's wedding had been on January 4, 1923, and Mag wasn't about
  to let her do it first, so she and Will Reiss were married
  secretly on January 1. Only Grandma Orsen knew about that, and
  after Mamie's wedding when bedtime came, Grandma and Mag really
  shocked everyone. Mag asked if it were all right if Will stayed
  overnight and slept with her, and Grandma said she didn't see why
  not! Mag and Will farmed near Taunton, a few miles northwest of
  Minneota. Incidentally, as they never had children, Alton Gould
  spent a lot of time with them. His mother Thea was sickly, and
  died in 1936 of cancer at the age of 47.</p>

  <p>Aunt Nora had married Perry Danielson in 1922 and they
  farmed near Hendricks and Ivanhoe, about twenty miles southwest
  of Minneota. Donna Mae was born in 1923, and Phyllis Floy on
  May 13, 1925 so there were lots of babies to see. They were too
  small for me to play with so Mama got rid of me part of the time
  at Alfred's or Nick's.</p>

  <p>I can remember riding with Uncle Walt in his great big
  Model T truck, and it had a gear shift on the floor besides the

  foot pedals. He used to play the fiddle and the saw, and could
  also really click out the rhythm on a pair of rattle bones he
  had. They were made of ebony, and about the size and shape of

  the fingerboard on a fiddle. By holding them just so between the
  fingers, and with the wrist action just right, he could really
  click away like a real good tap dancer. The saw he used was a
  regular cross cut, and he held it with the teeth toward him.
  With his knees close together, the handle under his right one,
  and the main part of the blade over his left, he held the tip
  with his left hand and bent it, stroking the back with a bow and
  varying the pitch with the amount of bending. I've tried it, but
  could never make a noise with a bow. Tapping it with a block of
  wood will make it "sing" though, in a whiny sort of a way.</p>

  <p>We used to ride horses at both Alfred's and Nick's, but I
  remember one of Alfred's horses the best because it had such

  tremendous hoofs, and was named Colonel. I thought that was a

  funny name for a horse, as I could only think of a "kernel" of

  corn or wheat. He was bigger than Bob or Blossom, and neither

  Walter nor I could ride him alone. Anton could though, and
  sometimes he would let us sit behind him and we'd go galloping
  down their long lane, hanging on for dear life. I had fun at
  Nick's too&mdash;he was hard of hearing like Mama. The boys and

  Tillie were all older, and Bernice a bit younger, but I was there
  enough to know them well.</p>

  <p>I might add that the Great Northern Railroad went from
  Warroad through Salol, Roseau, Fox, Badger, Greenbush,
  Strathcona, Middle River and Holt to Thief River Falls and then
  on south, which explains why those towns were there. Warroad was
  the northeast end of the line, and trains, both freight and
  passenger, went each way every day, turning around at Warroad.
  They used small old steam locomotives with their distinctive
  lonesome sounding whistle. The log cabin at Fox was almost as
  close to the tracks as a regular depot. There was, and still
  is, a "sand ridge" with swamp on each side, some running nearly
  all the way from Roseau to Greenbush where it curves towards
  Karlstad past "Twin Lakes Wildlife Area". I guess it was the
  shore of old Lake Agassiz, and made a natural solid bed for
  railroad and highway.</p>

  <p>Although there was no railraod from Greenbush to Karlstad,
  the train made the Normal school at Warroad easily accessable

  from Badger. Overnight mail service was normal, for only 2
  cents per letter. Now, with machine sorting and air mail and
  thirteen cents per ounce and rising, mail delivery is
  unpredictable. I heard that when the Postmaster General sent

  his letter of resignation to President Carter recently, it took
  several days to deliver it, right in Washington, D.C.!</p>

  <p>The regular passenger train usually provided service often
  enough, but the caboose on the freight could also be used by
  passengers in a pinch. It was rougher and slower and maybe
  dirtier, although there was some coal dust in the regular
  coaches, too.</p>

  <p>At Halma, the Sioux Line ran through the middle of town,
  only just a block or so from our house. The "Flyer" went
  straight from Winnipeg to the Twin Cities and it had big
  locomotives with several huge drive wheels. As it would generally
  only stop for passengers, it went screaming through at pretty
  good speed, dropping and picking up mail bags as it moved. They
  were hung on a post on the platform, and a hook was extended from
  the mail car to engage a loop on the bag. The train was notified
  by the depot agent by Morse code on the telegraph somehow, if it
  should stop for waiting passengers.</p>

  <p>The "Flyer" was a fancier, faster, and bigger train, with
  about twelve to fifteen passenger cars and a mail car, while the
  Great Northern had generally only three or four. The freights
  were longer, too, and we would watch and count the cars,
  sometimes fifty or more, carrying everything from grain to lumber
  to livestock to machinery&mdash;everything that trucks do now. A
  farmer shipping a carload of cattle, sheep or hogs (not many hogs

  up there) was entitled to ride along to the stockyards in South
  St. Paul in the caboose, to care for and water the animals on the
  way, and then bargain for the best price. Some local buyers had
  a small yard in which to keep small lots of individual animals
  until they accumulated a carload.</p>

  <p>Sometimes we would place pins or small coins on a rail and
  find them nice and flat after the train's steel wheels mashed
  them, and of course we would walk on the rails and try to see who
  could go the farthest without stepping off. Sometimes when we
  crossed one, someone would say "Don't you step upon the track, or
  you'll break your mother's back."</p>

  <h3><a name="i-remember--music">MUSIC</a></h3>

  <p>A family named "Wold" lived between us and the Haug school.
  They had several boys much older than me, but the youngest, about
  my age, I remember best because of his name which was "Redwold

  Wold". The older boys had built a radio&mdash;one of the first
  around there. It had lots of dials that had to be turned just
  right and a big old curved horn speaker. Sometimes when the

  weather was right, Papa would bundle us all up and we'd drive
  over there on a Saturday night in the cutter to see if they could
  get something. Sometimes they could get KDKA in Pittsburg and
  even the barn dance from WLS in Chicago, over all the signals and
  static. Northern lights bothered sometimes too, but it was quite
  a thing to hear things from so far off. Some improvements have
  been made since that time.</p>

  <p>When I was real small we had a phonograph that I believe was
  a "Silvertone". Newell had bought quite a few records and I used
  to play them by the hour. Before I could read, I knew them all
  and could tell them apart just by a little scratch or mark or
  color or the general appearance of the label. It seemed I always
  knew the difference, and by knowing one side, also knew what was
  on the back. My favorites were "Four Little Blackberries", (a
  xylophone piece) "Dardanella", "Saxophobia" by Rudy Wiedoft with
  Valse Erica on the back, "Asleep in the Deep" (a bass solo that
  really went down deep at the end), and a couple of Uncle Josh
  records on which he told funny stories&mdash;at least he laughed at
  the end of each funny line. I wish I had some of them now. We
  couldn't play the thick old Edison records that some people had.</p>

  <p>A few years ago I bought some old records at a sale and
  "Saxophobia" was one of them. After enjoying playing it several
  times, I bragged about having it to one of our teachers here and
  let him borrow it. He laid it on the seat of his car and someone
  sat on it. He tried for weeks to get it replaced, but had no
  luck. Only luck will ever turn up another playable copy I guess.</p>

  <p>Back at Haug and at Halma, when Papa led the choir, there
  often wasn't a piano or organ, or if there was, there was no one
  to play it. He would get out his old fiddle from its wooden case
  and play the various parts until the people knew them. He had a

  tuning fork to use to get perfect pitch for the fiddle and then
  would use the bow as a baton after playing the notes for the
  various parts to get started on. He loved good music and could
  also play the old fiddlers tunes like "Turkey in the Straw" and
  "Arkansas Traveler". It seems like he was even in a couple of
  old fiddlers contests.</p>

  <p>Mama loved music too, but as far as I know, she wasn't able
  to carry a tune herself. Possibly her ear trouble had something
  to do with that.</p>

  <p>Because the whole family enjoyed music, there was always a
  lot of it around our house, from the old Silvertone phonograph,
  to Papa's old fiddle and various choirs and groups. The four big
  girls made a fine quartet when they were all around at the same
  time, and Newell was a good tenor and could also yodel with the
  best of cowboys. They all sang in the choirs and so did Sylvia
  and I when we got big enough. Newell sang a lot of solos.
  The big girls also learned to play the organ (which we had gotten
  from Aunt Oline) but hardly enough to do it in public very much.
  One song I liked to hear them sing was "The Little Brown Church
  in the vale" with its chant of "Come, come, come" by the altos
  throughout the chorus.</p>

  <p>While I was in the "big room" at Halma, Papa got me a cheap
  violin from Sears or Monkey Wards and tried to teach me a little.
  I bet that there were times when Mama was glad that she couldn't
  hear too well. I'm also sure that Sylvia and I got away with
  lots of mischief because she couldn't hear what was going on!
  Anyway, when I got to Crookston they had me take violin lessons
  from a Miss Grace Waume, and she finally got me just a bit past
  the "Home Sweet Home" stage. I learned to count and read music
  a little. I even played second fiddle in the school orchestra,
  but that consisted mostly of being able to saw the right note at
  the right time. I never got beyond the first or basic position
  on the fingerboard. We are all glad to hear that Ivan's oldest
  girl, Kathy Folland, is a very gifted violinist and has earned
  college scholarships because of her ability, and is able to play
  First or "5010" violin in the Chattanooga Symphony at the present
  time. Her mother, Eunice, is of course a very accomplished
  violinist and musician.</p>

  <p>While in Karlstad high school, my voice changed to a fairly
  deep bass and I was able to sing the bass parts in music groups,
  even a boys quartet, when I was a senior. I think bass is
  probably the easiest of all if the vocal range is there, and at
  Roseau I sang in the choir, and also for many years here at Alta.
  At Roseau, our director was a Mrs. Rice, the former Gladys
  Edwardson, and she had been a soprano soloist in the famous St.

  Olaf choir from Northfield, Minnesota, under F. Melius
  Christianson. She was able to develop a pretty good group with
  the local talent that was available. Much later, Archie and

  Olga's middle daughter Norma was a soloist with the St. Olaf
  choir, and some records featuring her with that group were made.

  She also had a record made of herself singing several numbers
  fairly recently.</p>

  <p>I think it was in Haug, or maybe Halma, that a couple of
  guitars appeared. I think Clara had had a ukelele for some time
  and had learned to play a few chords on it. So had I. We used
  a felt pick to strum it with, to a few songs like "Ukelele Lady"
  that only required the three or four basic chords, but finally it
  was thought to be a bit too "mild" sounding so Clara and Tess
  sent to Monkey Wards or Sears for guitars. I believe they were
  identical and they came with accessories so they could be tuned a
  bit differently and used as a steel or Hawaiian type. One was
  used each way and we used to sit around and strum and sing quite
  a bit. I'm not positive, but I think it was Theresa's that I
  finally appropriated, and managed to learn the chords to quite a
  few popular songs of the time. I would sit and sing and strum
  and daydream&mdash;probably of girls that I would fascinate with my
  serenading. Maybe some of you will remember such old ones as "Me
  and the Moon", "I get the Blues when it Rains", "When it's Dark
  on Observatory Hill", "P.S. I Love You", "Shanty in Old Shanty
  Town", "Stars Fell on Alabama", "The Glory of Love", "Until the
  Real Thing Comes Along", "A Fine Romance", "You Turned the Tables
  on Me", "Empty Saddles in the Old Corral", "Darkness on the
  Delta", and others. I knew all the words to those and a lot of
  others, and in fact I did serenade a girl or two while in Roseau!</p>

  <p>I still have the old guitar, but it is pretty well dried out
  and warped from hanging in a closet since about 1941. I got it
  out last Christmas when Carol was thinking of getting one for
  Rich, and managed to tune it up and coax out a chord or two. My
  mechanic's fingers don't seem to reach or bend right any more,
  but it brought back a few of these old memories. When a person
  tries, something seems to happen nearly every day that brings
  back a memory or two.</p>

  <p>"Bake" Olson could do a marvelous imitation of Clyde McCoy
  doing "Sugar Blues" on his trumpet, using only his voice and
  cupping his hands over his mouth. We would really wow the gang
  that sometimes gathered at Olson's cabin at Birch beach for some
  fishing and swimming and eating on some weekends. I'll have to
  admit that I had several girls while at Roseau, and have
  snapshots to prove it. Donna neglected to put any of them in
  the big album!</p>

  <h3><a name="i-remember--halma-and-food">HALMA AND FOOD</a></h3>

  <p>We moved to Halma in 1927, when I started in the sixth
  grade, and I passed both sixth and seventh grade that year with
  Papa as teacher. Papa was very strict, and didn't hesitate to use
  a yardstick or something. He even dished out some whippings to
  the older boys who were sometimes bigger than he was.</p>

  <p>I find that I still have a few of my old report cards and
  that I passed the first grade at Badger in the spring of 1924. It showed that besides reading and writing and arithmetic, we
  had phonics, language and grammar, and construction, and that I
  was absent for twenty and one half days. Maybe I had a bad cold
  and was smeared with Mentholatum and musterole and a wool sock
  was wrapped around my neck and I was kept in bed. I passed grade
  II and III the next year and never missed a day. The next year
  was the fourth grade at Haug where Jewell L. Torkelson was my
  teacher in the "small" room. The subjects were the same except
  for "construction" and I didn't miss a day. Lenora Haug was my
  teacher in fifth grade there and then Papa gave me sixth and
  seventh in one year, and I didn't miss a day then either. I got
  my eighth grade diploma on July 30, 1929 by passing the state
  board exams in General Science, Ancient History, Geography,
  Hygiene and Sanitation, American History, Citizenship, Grammar
  and Composition, Reading, Spelling, and Arithmetic.</p>

  <p>In Halma we lived in a nice big house a couple of blocks or

  so from school. (Another block or so was out in the country
  again.) We lived next door to the elevator man, Peder Pederson
  and his wife, Lena. They had three little girls then and added

  two more, I think, while we lived there. The house was owned by
  T.L. Spilde, the grocery storekeeper, and was the first one that
  I remember that had a bathroom and electricity. There was also a
  small barn and wooded pasture.</p>

  <p>We generally had three cows that I had to learn to milk as
  soon as I was big enough to hold a small pail between my knees,
  and I also had to clean the barn. We used to pile the manure on
  a wheelbarrow and push it out behind to the pile that
  accumulated. The loads were pretty small at first, but as I
  grew, I could handle bigger and bigger ones. Snow drifts were
  always a problem&mdash;it was even hard to get the door open, but with
  the three cows and at least a couple of calves in it, the barn
  was generally fairly warm. Leaning against a cow and pulling
  teats helped too, and fingers stayed warm, but got pretty tired

  at first. There were always a couple of cats around that got a
  saucer of warm whole milk! A few of them even learmed to catch a
  stream of milk in their mouths when we'd give a squirt in their
  direction. They could always lick it off their fur when we

  missed the open mouth and squirted it all over them.</p>

  <p>Sylvia mentioned the skis Papa made at Halma and I
  better add a little. After getting the right sized boards at the
  lumber yard, he tapered the ends after determining the direction

  of the grain in them that would let them slide the best. He
  fashioned a device to clamp and wire the tapered ends over a
  wooden log so they could be bent and clamped. The ends were

  boiled in the boiler for a couple of hours first and then bent
  and clamped and left to dry, and they stayed that way. We didn't
  have clamps or good binding for our shoes, but just stuck our
  toes through a loop of harness leather that was nailed to about
  the middle of them, and we managed to slide along and got a lot
  of cold snowy exercise. How we wished for a real hill to try
  them on. I soon learned to stand up while sliding down a straw
  stack, but I think Sylvia usually ended up sitting.</p>

  <p>A neighbor farm boy, Joseph Spilde, had a horse, and we
  sometimes took turns riding it and pulling the other on the skis,
  using a long rope. It wasn't too easy to stay on the horse and
  pull someone with the rope around your waist (no saddle), but we
  had fun. In later years we used a car on a frozen lake to pull
  several kids around at a time, if the snow wasn't too deep, and
  got some real fast rides that way.</p>

  <p>We didn't attempt to keep the snow away from the path to the
  barn&mdash;just kept tramping it down. Of course, it got pretty
  hard and treacherous, and in the spring after the rest of the
  snow had mostly melted, there was that old icy path, still
  standing several inches high!</p>

  <p>I don't remember when we first got a cream separator, but
  they were invented by Carl Gustaf De Laval in Sweden in 1877. I
  suppose the real first one was a wooden spoon that was used to
  skim off the cream after it had come to the top after sitting
  overnight or so. It was a lot simpler to wash than the machine
  too. Ours was a De Laval, made in America, I suppose, and had
  about a five gallon tank on top.</p>

  <p>The milk ran through a faucet on the tank to a small chamber
  with a float in it. The float rose up against the faucet and
  partially shut it off to regulate the flow from the faucet into
  the center of a very rapidly rotating bowl. This bowl was a very
  heavy (several pounds) affair, shaped like a cone, with the small
  end up. The bottom fit over a spindle that whirled it through a
  system of gears turned by a crank. It was very hard to get
  started and get it up to proper speed, but the crank had a bell
  on it that quit dinging when the handle went around at the right
  speed of about 60 r.p.m.. It wasn't real hard turning after that.
  The skim milk, being heavier, flew to the outside of the whirling
  bowl and came out the lower spout. The cream stayed in the
  center and came out of the top spout. They were arranged to
  enclose the thing and confine the stuff in the proper place.
  When finished, some water was poured in to rinse the works out
  and generally allowed to run into the can that caught the skim
  milk. We nearly always drank whole milk and had cream on cereals
  and fruit. Of course the coffee always got the real thing too.</p>

  <p>Some cream was churned into butter, but generally it was

  sold to the creamery that was in every little town. Skim milk
  was fed to the calves and some made into cottage cheese. Some
  was allowed to sour and get thick and fed to the chickens. A
  few times Mama pressed some cottage cheese into some cloth tubes
  and let it turn into "gammel Ost". I didn't like it then, but

  probably would now.</p>

  <p>Washing the separator was a job! The heavy bowl came apart
  by setting it on a certain place provided in the separator, and
  the big nut on its top would unscrew with a special wrench.
  Inside was a stack of about thirty metal cone-shaped disks, with
  holes at the proper places for the milk and cream to come
  through. They all had to be washed and then hung on a sort of

  huge safety pin device until the next time, when it all had to be
  assembled again.</p>

  <p>We sold some whole milk to neighbors and Sylvia and I would
  get a few pennies for delivering it. It was put in 1/2 gallon
  syrup pails mostly, and we had a supply of them, as we liked
  pancakes and waffles and french fried toast, and we liked that
  stuff soaked in syrup. Papa nearly always finished a meal with
  some too, putting a big spoonful on his plate and then scraping
  it up with his knife and smearing it on his bread. I always
  liked it that way too, but I liked white syrup better than brown.
  Mama sometimes made imitation maple syrup for waffles and we all
  liked that.</p>

  <p>A bowl of coarse grained "loaf sugar" was always on the
  table too, and though no one used sugar in coffee, those
  dissolved rather slowly and Papa would dip one in his coffee and
  suck on it a couple times before having to pop it in his mouth
  and finish his coffee through it. Sometimes he would let me and
  Sylvia have one to dip in his coffee and suck on too. Nowadays
  the fine sugar cubes dissolve too fast to be used that way. We
  also had a toothpick holder with "Souvenir of Minneota,
  Minnesota" written on it in red, and that was around for all my
  life at home. I think one of the girls still has it.</p>

  <p>When Thelma was here last, we were talking about some of the
  old oak furniture I had refinished and we recalled the time at
  Haug when she and Mama redid our old round dining room table.
  They used hot lye solution, and scrubbed and scraped for hours to

  get the old varnish off. I don't know how they protected their
  hands, but they still had fingers when they finished, and I guess
  it looked pretty good too. We ate a lot of good meals on that

  table, and it had several leaves so it could be stretched out to
  fit everybody, and that was a gang. It took quite a beating, as
  it was used for lots of things besides eating. Sylvia and I
  sometimes forgot the flat irons and would crack hazel nuts on it
  with a hammer. Some years there was a good crop of them, and we
  would pick several gunny sacks of them and then spread them out
  to dry so they could be husked. They are actually wild filberts,
  and about 1/2 their size. Arlys now has that round oak table.</p>

  <p>Lye was also used to make soap after butchering, but I was
  never in on that. I remember Mama and the girls using a knife to
  slice off curls of laundry soap, sometimes "Fels Naptha", into
  the boiler that was on the kitchen stove, though. Seems that all
  white things had to be boiled, and then lots of blueing used too,
  in order to get them clean. A good part of every wash was
  starched too. The old stick that was used to fish the clothes
  out of the boiler got pretty clean and white, as did the hands
  that rubbed them on the scrubbing board. Sometimes I got to turn
  the crank on the wringer that clamped on the side of a tub, and
  later had to push and pull the long lever that ran the old wooden
  paddle mounted in the lid of the wooden washing machine after we
  got one of those. The windows really got steamed over on
  washdays, and fingers must have really been cold after pinning a

  batch of clothes on a line outside in winter. They were nearly
  all hung outside though, and seemed to lose a lot of their
  moisture by freezing as stiff asa board. Then they were
  brought in to thaw out and finish drying. I don't remember if we
  ever had a Maytag with a gasoline engine with a long flexible
  exhaust hose and foot pedal starter, but can remember working on
  those engines at Archie Lee's place in Roseau. He sold them, and
  we thought the late models with a (vibration free?) 2 cylinder
  engine and balloon wringers and square aluminum tubs were really
  something.</p>

  <p>In the spring, when things had all thawed out, the manure
  pile was spread on and worked into the big garden that Papa

  always had. He would start tomatoes and cabbages in boxes
  inside. He also rigged up a "cold frame" from old storm
  windows. He always had a dandy garden and tried to interest me
  in it, but I always thought it was really punishment, even in 4-H. I never had much luck, and I don't like gardening to this

  day. I was glad when we moved here and didn't have a good space
  for one! That's almost sacrilegious with my background, but it's
  true. I like to look at a nice garden, and admire anyone who can
  work in one and make things grow well, but it's not for me.</p>

  <p>At Haug at least, we had turkeys, but we had chickens

  wherever we lived. Sometimes an old hen would get "broody" and
  sneak off to a hidden nest, showing up in about three weeks with
  a dozen or so little peepers following. Mama had a kerosene
  burning incubator, and though it took a lot of watching, she
  managed to hatch out a few batches. It was fun for Sylvia and me
  to watch the shells start to break, and the wet little chicks
  come out. Mostly though, Mama would save her winter "egg money"
  and buy day-old chicks from a hatchery, and the mailman would
  bring a big ventilated box of them. I don't suppose they can be

  mailed these days, except by private carrier, but now I guess a
  person would just drive to a hatchery for them if anyone would
  bother.</p>

  <p>The tiny chicks were kept in the house, in a box or tub
  until they were big enough to eat well, and the weather got warm
  enough outside. Papa would build a pen of some sort to keep
  them in until they were big enough to put in the chicken house
  which generally had a fairly big yard enclosed by chicken wire
  fence. Sometimes the wing feathers had to be clipped to keep
  them from flying over it. We ate a lot of the young tender
  roosters, and of course Mama or Thelma would chop off their heads
  and pluck and clean them. In the fall, a bunch were generally
  canned in the old Mason jars as was a lot of the other, meat,
  mostly 'the beef. They would boil the filled jars in the old
  copper wash boiler for a long time, and it was quite a job.</p>

  <p>A lot of wild berries were canned into delicious sauce,
  mostly strawberries, but sometimes Juneberries and blueberries,
  high bush cranberries and rhubarb. They always mixed some
  rhubarb with Juneberries to give it a litle more "zip." Some
  years the wild berry crop was almost unbelievable, and I can

  remember them fixing over fifty quarts of the tiny wild
  strawberries at times. Picking them was hard work, but we would
  eat a lot too, which made it easier. Of course we ate big bowls
  of fresh ones, with cream too, and they made jars and jars of
  jams and jellies. Tomatoes were regarded as fruit and we cut
  them up and ate them with cream and sugar like peaches. Choke
  cherries would pucker up your mouth even when real ripe, but we
  would add a lot of sugar to a big bowl of them and mash and mix
  them up with the wooden potato masher. We called it "Spit Sauce"
  because there was probably a bigger amount of small pits to spit
  out than the edible fruit and juice on the little cherries. A
  person's mouth would be a nice purple, too.</p>

  <p>We had a lot of stuff fresh from Papa's big gardens, but
  Mama and the girls canned a lot too, and there were lots of

  shelves filled with full jars every fall. Picking wild berries
  always presented the problem of poison ivy or oak and we had
  learned to identify the ivy while quite small. I still don't

  know what poison oak is like for certain, but the itch was worse
  than ivy. I guess intensive farming and chemical sprays have put
  an end to the wild berry crops in many places now, and have even
  reduced mosquitos. They were really bad at times and we wore
  long sleeves and even scarves for some protection. They were
  really huge and hungry and there were stories about some extra
  big ones poking their stingers clear through a baby or small
  animal and flying away with it. I never actually saw that
  happen, but there really were big swarms of them, almost clouds
  at times.</p>

  <p>Lillian once took a course in canning for 4-H and her group
  got a trip to the Minnesota State Fair. That helped make some of
  the projects more successful. I really liked a piece of cold
  chicken or beef pried out of the jelly in the jar, but the pork
  would have a lot of lard on it, so it was necessary to heat that.
  They would render big crocks of lard too. Sometimes eggs were
  preserved in a huge crock of "water glass" (in case anyone
  cares, that is sodium metasilicate and seals the pores of the
  shell, keeping it airtight), as most hens here took the winter
  off from their main job, but they still had to be fed and
  watered, and the chicken house cleaned!</p>

  <p>Potato lefse, milk lefse and flatbread were made too. Those
  delicacies were made by rolling dough into huge thin discs, up to
  nearly three feet across, that were baked on top of the kitchen

  stove. Flatbread was the thinnest, almost as thin as wrapping
  paper, and all these discs were handled by a pointed stick,
  almost as long as a yardstick. Papa made the sticks, and they

  were whittled to an edge on each side, and sanded real smooth.
  It took practice, but the stick could be slid under a piece to
  the center, and then it was picked up and carefully put down on

  the stove. Turning them over was pretty hard, especially the

  flatbread as it became real crisp and fragile, but Mama was an

  expert and the girls learned too. Mama made the bread and buns

  of various kinds, with Christmas bread and fruit cake in season,

  too. They also regularly made Fattig Mon and Rosettes, and they

  were real fragile, but just delicious, and melted in your mouth.</p>

  <p>Mustn't forget Sprroot Baakilsa. The "Sproot" dough was
  packed in a grease-gun-like tube from which it was pushed out of
  one end through different patterned holes in a a disk. It came

  out in a toothpaste like ribbon about 1/2" in diameter and then
  could be laid in circles or letters or whatever on a pan and
  baked. One disk made a sort of flat ribbon, so that made small
  straight ribbed sticks. Flatbread and lefse had to be cut in
  quarters to be handled and stacked for keeping, and the flatbread
  was then broken into smaller pieces and several pieces stacked up
  to eat, with lots of butter between them. Lefse pieces were
  buttered and sugared and rolled up to be eaten. Milk lefse
  especially, was generally cut into pie-shaped wedges, with
  butter, cinnamon, and (usually brown) sugar between a couple of
  slices, and was stored that way in stacks wrapped in a dishtowel.
  They were my favorites, although I loved the other stuff too. We
  all looked forward to a lefse and lutefisk supper at Christmas
  time.</p>

  <p>We have had lutefisk a few times down here, but our kids
  never liked it, and now it has become real expensive. Way back
  though, I can remember big stacks of the split, frozen cod at the
  grocery stores, which was brought home that way to prepare in lye

  solution, etc. It became real slippery when cooked. When eaten
  with boiled potatoes and soaked with real melted butter, it
  really just slid down your throat. Add a roll of lefse, and

  flatbread too, and it made a real feast!</p>

  <p>Of course we had turkey, and sage stuffing, and Newell was a
  good hunter so we had partidges, ducks, and occasionally a goose.
  Later there was sometimes a pheasant, but one had to get them
  from farther south, as they stayed away from this icy region.
  They are smart birds! Shortly before World War II I went
  with Harry a couple of times to Central Minnesota after
  pheasants. He had a good dog that could find the birds if there
  were any. Harry seldom missed one, but I was never any good at
  it. I used to get some ruffed grouse though (we called them
  partridges) while at Roseau. I used to go mostly with "Bake"
  Olson and his dad, and we would walk the trails in the woods
  south of Lake of the Woods, east of Warroad. The dumb birds
  would come out on the trails and stand there looking, and we'd
  try to shoot them in the eye with a 22, so as not to hurt the
  breast, which was really good white meat. Once Mr. Olson and I
  bagged several geese too.</p>

  <p>I mustn't forget Rrrooma Grot&mdash;a cream porridge or pudding
  which was eaten from a bowl, and covered with pure cream, sugar
  and cinnamon. Not for people on a diet!

  Mama and the girls made a lot of their clothes too, and
  didn't have an electric zigzag either, but the old treadle
  machine with a narrow round leather belt that was hooked together

  by a sort of paper clip affair. Nobody had heard of a "V" belt I
  suppose, at least a fabric and rubber one.</p>

  <p>Seems I haven't said anything about getting wood to heat and

  cook with. It was used almost exclusively for both, except on
  hot summer days a kerosene burning affair was sometimes used for
  cooking and heating water to wash clothes. Sometimes if the

  house had a furnace a little coal was used in order to keep the
  fire going better all night without further feeding it. Lumber
  yards and elevators generally stocked it, and bituminous was used
  mostly, although some anthracite was also used in the old pot-
  bellied heaters, as it was cleaner and almost smokeless, but more
  expensive. At Halma, some North Dakota lignite was used too, but
  that burned faster and was really soft, being only a few thousand
  years older than the peat, from which all the stuff got its
  start. It was very light in color&mdash;almost brown&mdash;and evidently
  it contained a lot of moisture, as a hot fire was needed to get
  it started burning, and it was very smoky.</p>

  <p>White poplar was used mostly, as it was plentiful and also
  the easiest to chop and split. No trees grew real big up north,
  a poplar over a foot in diameter being quite rare. A six or
  eight inch one about twenty to twenty-five feet tall was about
  the right size to handle, and of course they were felled with the

  old "double bitted" axe which was kept razor sharp. The trees
  were always out in the winter for several reasons. One was that
  there was time out from gardening and other work. Another was

  that the "popple" cut and split the easiest when frozen, and it
  was much easier to load a low sleigh with the logs than a high

  wheeled wagon. The trees were cut down and trimmed of branches
  and dragged by had to piles along the trails. They were then
  rolled onto one side of the sleigh, from which the stakes were
  pulled out until a fair sized load had been piled on it. Then

  the stakes were put back in and the load finished up with the
  smaller logs which had to be lifted to the top, generally one end
  at a time. When the horses had parked the load in a suitable
  place in the yard, the stakes were pulled out of one side again
  and the logs rolled off and piled up to wait for the sawyers to
  get to it.</p>

  <p>The saw was mounted on a wooden frame and pulled around on a
  sleigh or low wheeled wagon. It took a crew of about four men
  to run things, to carry the logs up and push them against the
  blade, and one man to hold the end which was cut off at a
  suitable length and tossed in a pile to cure. The engines were
  heavy old cast iron affairs with just a tank on top to hold
  cooling water. It was a part of the engine and extended around
  the cylinder, and boiled constantly. The flywheels were maybe
  three feet in diameter and very heavy, and to start it, one was
  grabbed by the rim and turned by hand with quite some effort.
  There was an oiler on top that dropped oil by the drop through a
  tube and oiled the pistons and rings through a small hole in the
  cylinder wall. The rod, which wasn't covered, had a grease cup
  on it that was given a turn or two whenever it stopped. As you
  might guess, it wasn't very high speed, probably 1000 or 2000 rpm
  being top. The valves weren't covered either and so could be
  given an occasional squirt of oil. The governor worked by
  shutting off the spark when it got up to speed, so when it had no

  load, it only fired as needed to keep going. A genuine hit and
  miss affair.</p>

  <p>A thick (maybe 1/4 to 3/8 inch thick) flat belt of
  rubberized canvas fabric was used and was from four to eight

  inches wide. The wide flat pulleys had a slight crown in the
  center, which seemed to help keep them on and give better
  traction. For traction, the longer the better, so the saw
  mandrel and engine were generally mounted eight to ten feet
  apart. Some old engines had a governor that would hold the

  intake valve open when it went past the desired speed, as it
  couldn't inhale fuel then and wouldn't fire.</p>

  <p>The blade itself was about two and one half or three feet
  in diameter and was kept sharp by a guy who knew how to use a
  file, before the start of every job. Some "Balm of Gilead" trees
  were out too, but they were tougher to split, and also burned
  almost as fast as cardboard when cured. There was very little
  oak at Halma or Karlstad and anyway it was too tough and hard to
  cut, so the sawyer often wouldn't even let a piece touch his saw.
  An occasional small birch was sometimes cut, and it made fine
  furnace fuel. The wood for the kitchen range was always split, a
  piece of about four inches in diameter split in four pieces being
  about the right size. Papa taught me the proper way to do it
  when I was about nine or ten, and was extra careful to be sure I
  placed my feet so the axe couldn't accidentally glance off and
  strike me. I started with a small axe and got bigger ones as I
  grew stronger.</p>

  <p>A huge pile was needed for the season, and as it took about
  a whole summer to cure, a huge pile was always kept on hand. Few
  people took time to stack it orderly, or keep more than a few

  rainy days' supply in the woodshed. Some was split finer for
  kindling, but apple boxes etc. were also usually available for
  that. A few split pieces were used in the furnace or heater,
  too, but mostly whole chunks were used for heating, as they
  didn't burn as fast. The biggest ones were used at night. In
  Iowa, Ila's folks burned corn cobs which were saved for that
  after the sheller had been around. There were lots of cobs, but

  few trees suitable there.</p>

  <p>Frying pans were usually cast iron and just the right size
  so that a stove lid could be removed and the pan fit in place of
  it, directly over the flame. The waffle iron that I remember was
  also made to fit directly over the fire box, and as each side
  held a waffle, could make two at a time. It was turned over,
  and the top side opened alternately and heated again the next
  time over. It took a real hot fire for waffles, and as we liked
  them so well and ate a lot, Mama must have gotten pretty hot and
  tired after a session of that, before she could sit down and have
  one. Washing the waffle iron must have been a job too, with both
  sides covered with soot! After spending a morning like that, and
  the rest of the day ironing piles of clothes&mdash;starched white
  shirts and petticoats, too&mdash;sitting down to an evening of

  mending and darning by lamplight must have seemed like a
  pleasure. Do you suppose?</p>

  <p>We never heard Mama complain, and she always managed to stay
  awake and have us say our prayers before she tucked us up in bed,
  until we were pretty big. We said prayers in Norwegian for a
  long time, and the Lord's prayer always in that language until we
  were in high school at least. Now I can only remember the first
  few lines of it. In Halma, Rev. Kluver had regular Norwegian
  services, but of course I could only get an occasional word.
  They were held for the benefit of the older people.
  Incidentally, he also served the church in Karlstad, and with
  Rev. Nervig of Roseau, officiated at Mama's funeral in 1937.</p>

  <p>Sometimes old railroad ties were found and sawed up for
  furnace wood, and they were big enough to make dandy chunks for
  nightime use in a furnace. Around Roseau there were some
  tamarack trees in some swampy areas and they made good fuel for
  Archie's big implement shop and building, which took a lot of
  heat even though the entire building wasn't heated. Tamarack
  looked a lot like scrubby spruce or pine, but shed its needles in
  the fall, so an area full of them looked like a bunch of old dead
  trees in winter. Tamarack spruce produced resinous smoke and
  only a place with a good big chimney could safely use it.
  Deposits collected which would sometimes ignite and then there
  would be a chimney fire.</p>

  <p>Oil burners were used a lot by then, but wood was still the
  old standby, and of course was cheaper but meant a lot more work.
  Homemade stoves were used a lot where looks weren't important.
  Legs were available to fit old fifty-five gallon oil barrels

  which were mounted horizontally on them. Most of one end was
  then cut out and a door and damper (also available) were bolted
  on, and also a fitting for the smoke pipe. Often, a second

  barrel was mounted on top and arranged so the smoke had to pass
  through the length of it too, and give off some extra heat&mdash;before going up the chimney. When the fires were first lit in
  the mornings, and before the entire room was warmed up, a person
  would have to stand close to the fire and keep turning to get
  warm all over.</p>

  <p>One Christmas, a year or two or so before Newell and Lil
  were married, everyone was home on the 24th except him. Evening
  came and a real howling blizzard developed. We all thought we
  would have our first Christmas without Newell. But after supper
  we heard the porch doors slam and feet stomp and Newell was
  there, in a big sheepskin coat, with a sack on his back full of
  presents and scarves covering all but his eyes. After sweeping
  off the snow and icicles and getting some breath back, we found
  that he had managed to drive his Model T Coupe from Badger to
  Karlstad and had walked from there to Halma against the blizzard,
  along the railroad tracks to get home. The trains probably had
  plows on, and were running, but the Sioux Line went the wrong way
  in the evening for him to use. By walking the track, he was sure
  of not getting lost, and being built up some, the track was blown

  clear of snow except in a few places. It was also the shortest
  route so he was able to make it. I guess the "Home for
  Christmas" feeling is pretty strong, and I hope it never stops,
  although such heroic efforts aren't needed any more, even if
  blizzards stop all travel at times.</p>

  <p>One time at least, I hiked with the rest of my class to
  Bronson for our spring picnic, along the track, as it was the
  shortest way. (about six miles) Now, highway 59 runs alongside
  it for miles, and Gary was impressed with it in 1973 when we'were
  up there, as it was the longest, levellest and straightest road
  he had ever seen. Everyone will always remember the big stone at
  the corner of Folland's farm, part of which was blasted off years
  ago and used in the foundations of some of their buildings. I
  bet a lot of people have had a snapshot taken of themselves on
  it, as Gary did then.</p>

  <h3><a name="i-remember--the-follands-and-farming">THE FOLLANDS AND FARMING</a></h3>

  <p>We had been friends of the Follands ever since the first
  time we lived in Halma when I was born. In fact, Torger's folks
  were my Godparents when I was baptised. I got my first real job
  out there in the fall when I was in about sixth grade.</p>

  <p>We were still in Halma with no high school and as I was
  pretty small and still only twelve that fall, I stayed home a

  year and don't remember what I did all winter. I went to school
  some again and I picked spuds at Follands and did some plowing
  there too. Plowing was real easy with a single furrow plow and

  three horses, as one horse walked in the previously made furrow
  and it was hardly necessary to even steer except at the ends.
  It was also monotonous and some fall days were pretty cold, with
  snowflakes coming down at times. A two bottom plow generally
  took five horses to pull, with one team hooked in front of the
  three on the plow. Turning at the ends was harder, but really
  more fun, and I felt pretty big when I got to drive that. Horses
  are pretty smart and knew what was expected of them, and a good
  team in the lead made that a pretty easy job. I often rode
  out 'there on my bike as it was only two and a half miles, but a
  couple of those real dry summers the two miles of dirt road going
  north was really pure fine sand&mdash;almost dust, and the bike would
  sink in almost as deep as the tires. After a rain though, it was
  almost like a sidewalk and real easy to ride on.</p>

  <p>Follands always had several acres of potatoes every year, as
  did lots of farmers in that area. They were actually dug by a
  machine pulled by four and sometimes six horses. A pointed
  shovel-like "share" penetrated the ground, going under the spuds
  and raising them to a chain of about eighteen-inch iron cross
  bars. This moved them up an incline about four feet high,
  shaking the dirt and vines and weeds loose on the way. Then they
  fell back to the ground and had to be picked up by hand. That's
  where jobs for school kids came in and we always had a two week
  "potato vacation."</p>

  <p>All the kids that were big enough had jobs for money for new
  clothes and a little Christmas money, as the general pay was four
  or five and sometimes six cents a bushel. Depending on how good
  the crop was, and how backs and bare hands could stand it, a
  strong kid could pick up to a hundred bushels a day. A bushel of

  spuds weighs about sixty pounds. We picked them into one-half
  bushel wire baskets, and we dumped two basketsful into
  gunnysacks. They were then picked up by a horse drawn wagon
  when we had enough standing along the rows to make a load. We

  each carried a bundle of empty sacks on our backs, tied on with a
  belt or rope, and as there were usually several pickers in a
  field at a time, we each carried small pieces of cardboard with
  our number on it. We put our number in each sack. When they
  were emptied in the bin in the potato cellar, the tags were all
  saved and then counted to determine each picker's wages for the
  day.</p>

  <p>The first time over, only alternate rows were dug to leave
  enough space to do a good job, and drive the pick up wagon
  through easily.</p>

  <p>The potato cellar was a partially underground affair that
  had the roof covered with a large amount of horse manure and

  straw. The horse manure generated its own heat and the potatoes
  didn't freeze. Some were kept until spring, hoping for higher
  prices. They were sorted while moving over a coarse wire screen
  and then bagged in new two bushel sacks and sewn shut with a big
  needle and twine. Then they were sold through a warehouse in

  Halma and shipped away by the 600 bushel railroad carload.</p>

  <p>Grandma Folland (Torger's mother) fed us all and as they had
  a big house, we boys slept there too. They had a big partially
  finished attic, and we climbed a steep narrow stairway and slept
  up there. It sometimes got pretty cold but we were always ready
  for bed. She had handmade quilts filled with home grown wool
  she had washed and carded herself, so we were real warm and hated
  to get up. It was quite a trip clear to the attic, so we had the
  old familiar chamber pot with us.</p>

  <p>They always had a lot of livestock. There were about one
  hundred sheep that had a crop of at least that number of lambs
  every spring, some hogs, and up to forty Holstein milk cows with
  their assorted calves. Also eight or ten work horses that
  sometimes had a colt. There were no riding or really good
  driving horses there by that time, although I would sometimes

  crawl onto one to ride to and from different fields that we
  worked in.</p>

  <p>Torger was a pretty good veterinarian and did almost all of
  that type of work himself, including helping to deliver calves
  and lambs, and castrating male animals. I remember "helping" or
  at least watching at times.</p>

  <p>He did the butchering, too, and with the help of his Dad or
  one of his four brothers and a block and tackle, could scald a

  hog in a barrel of hot water and scrape off the bristles and cut
  it up in a short time. He could skin a big calf too, and the
  hides from these were salted and sold. Some of the meat was
  allowed to freeze, and of course it never thawed all winter.
  Some was lowered by rope into the well where the cream cans were
  kept. Down there the temperature didn't vary much, winter or
  summer. The blood was saved and used for blood sausage (Brro Bol
  as we called it). I guess it was a concoction of ground raw
  potatoes and blood and spices that was packed into cloth bags
  (sometimes a small salt sack). They were then boiled, the cloth
  peeled off and the stuff sliced and eaten with butter and lots of
  syrup. I liked it best after it was a few days old, then cut up
  and fried.</p>

  <p>There was also good head cheese. The hog heads were boiled
  and the meat picked off. Then it was pressed into cloth sacks
  or loaves. It was well spiced and made a delicious lunch meat.
  There were various recipes and methods of making it. Each

  Norwegian family made it a bit differently, by recipes handed
  down through generations!</p>

  <p>About that time, 1928 or 29, Torger and his dad and brother
  had built their dairy herd to about 40 milk cows (Holsteins) and
  had acquired a milking machine. They fixed up a nice room in
  the barn in which to do the separating and washing up. Torger's
  father was a rather portly but dignified old gentleman, with pure
  white hair and a well-kept white moustache. Neither he nor his
  wife could speak English well, but could understand well enough.
  Although I couldn't speak Norwegian, I could understand most of
  it at that time, and we got along fine talking the different

  languages to each other. They were typical old Norwegian
  pioneers and homesteaders, and had earned their way by hard and
  unceasing work. I can remember her carding the homegrown wool

  after repeated washing of the fleeces, and then using the old
  spinning wheel to make the yarn from which to knit socks,
  mittens, sweaters and even gloves. I guess Grandma Orsen did
  that too, but I don't remember that.</p>

  <p>Torger was an expert at shearing (every spring), using old
  style shears (power clippers later) and somtimes got the wool off
  in one piece like an overcoat, if it was in real good condition
  and not torn by brush or a fence. He would sit on a stool and
  set a sheep on its rear haunches with its body between his knees.
  He'd start on its head and shear the fleece right down to the

  bottom. It was then folded into a bale and tied with woolen
  twine. Most of them were sold. When handling wool all day, a
  person's hands would get nice and soft from all the oil
  (lanolin) in the wool. Most of the lambs were sold in the fall,

  but occasionally a nice fat one was butchered for a little change
  in diet.</p>

  <p>Mr. Folland's regular job was turning the cream separator,
  and though it was one with a large capacity, it took a lot of
  turning to run the milk from 40 good cows through it, especially
  in the early summer when production was highest. He was able to

  do it without too much effort, and seemed to enjoy watching the
  stream of pure cream slowly fill up the big cream can. It's too
  bad there wasn't a market for skim milk then. Although large
  amounts were fed to calves and hogs, a lot was wasted.</p>

  <p>Torger remodeled part of the second floor of the big house
  into a nice apartment. He also put an outside stairway on the

  north side. It was into this that he and Thelma moved after
  their wedding in Halma on June 14, 1930, and their honeymoon to
  Yellowstone park. Torger had a new 2-door enclosed Model A Ford

  with all its modern accessories, so they traveled in comfort if
  not luxury!</p>

  <p>They still had no electricity, as that far north country
  was too sparsely settled to have the REA put up lines. Parts of
  Iowa put up lines in about 1932. A very few farms had their own
  32 volt battery powered plants, which were charged by wind or
  gasoline engine driven generators and had the capacity for lights
  only. The wind had to be brisk or the engine started in order to
  carry the load if an electric iron was used. The Silmer family,
  which had some very mechanical minded boys who were cousins of
  Torger, had such a plant.</p>

  <p>The Follands, however, probably used the next best
  substitute. They had gas lights, and I think a hot plate or two
  which could beat up the coffee pot in a hurry and do light

  cooking in the summer. The lights each had a flint lighter.
  The gas was turned on, the handle on the lighter twisted, and
  there was light! Of course a match would work if the flint wore

  out or didn't work, and the light, although not much better than
  kerosene lamps, at least was handier and cleaner. Besides, they
  had their own gas plant! It was located in a pit behind the
  house and was covered with horse manure and flax straw to keep
  from freezing. There was a big trapdoor on top for servicing. A
  100 lb. can of calcium carbide granules was dumped into a
  compartment, from which a small amount at a time was added to a
  little water to make acetylene gas. This was done automatically
  as needed, through a system of floats and levers. The gas
  generated was stored in a tank arrangement of two big barrels.
  The top one fit closely upside down, into, or on the outside of
  the other one. It was free enough to rise and fall, providing
  constant gas pressure by its weight. As the gas was let out and
  used, more was generated by another small mixture of carbide and
  water. The gas was piped to all the buildings that were used
  after dark. In winter, dark came early in the evening and
  lasted late in the mornings. Torger always took care of the
  maintenance of the gas plant.</p>

  <p>Of course I liked to visit my big sister and new brother-in-
  law, and as I was big enough by then to drive horses, was soon
  put to work in the hay field. I drove a rake at first, making
  sizeable windrows out of the partially cured hay in the swaths
  cut by the mowers a day or so before. The windrows were in turn
  straddled by the rake and the hay pulled into rows of large
  "bunches." Finally the "bunches" were pulled together by a

  bucking pole into a stack, which was left there in the middle of

  the field until needed in the winter. Then they were hauled
  home on a sleigh, a hayrackful at a time, and they were dug out
  of the snow and loaded by hand with the good old pitchfork. I

  was spared from that, having school to attend. I drove a mower a
  lot too, and as there was no alfalfa, but only wild meadow grass
  cut for hay, a lot of acres had to be cut, especially in dry
  years, to get enough hay for the 40 cows and 10 or 12 horses and
  the other assorted live stock. One or two years some dry swamp
  had to be cut that had never been touched before. It was
  mostly old dead grass, but it pulled the hungry stock through the
  winter.</p>

  <p>A "bucking pole" was a very simple affair, being only two
  strong 2x10 planks about 20 feet long, with several blocks
  between them at intervals. The whole assembly was about 10
  inches high when lying flat, and not very heavy. To each end,
  about a twenty foot length of log chain with a double tree on it
  was attached by a clevis, and a good team hitched to each. This
  was used by driving one team on each side of a row of bunches.
  The bunches were then slid together by the pole to about the
  middle of the field, where two or three men with pitchforks
  leveled and "built" the new haystack. After the proper size base
  had been pushed together, several planks were laid on one end and
  the next loads slid up the incline and spread out. After a load
  was pulled up, the chain on one end was unhooked and the bucking
  pole pulled out endwise by one team. The driver usually stood
  on it for the ride out to get the next load. As the stack got
  higher the horses were urged into a trot to make sure the load
  got pulled clear to the top. One driver, usually Torger, handled

  both teams at once. Only the last year or so was I able to do
  it. It was fun to stand on the pole with its load of hay in
  front, guiding one team with each hand, trotting the final few

  yards, and riding up to the top of the stack.</p>

  <p>At first, my job was to drive the rake and clean up the
  paths of the bucking pole and dump my rake loads where the pole
  would get them on its next trip. The stack was rounded off on
  top to shed the rain, usually by tossing a small load from a
  hayrack to the men on top.</p>

  <p>Bucking poles wouldn't work on alfalfa. It wouldn't slide
  like wild hay would on sod. It just rolled into a ball and the
  pole would roll over the top of it. The few people who had
  alfalfa would use a modified bucking pole with long wooden teeth
  projecting from the front called a sweeprake. The teeth slid
  under the alfalfa and carried it off the ground. A sweeprake
  couldn't slide up a stack though, so stacking had to be done by
  hand. Some models had small wheels near the back. A few
  "stackers" were built out of a big wooden framework and a fairly
  big bunch of hay could be pulled up with ropes and pulleys and
  horsepower and dumped or pushed off. When rubber tires and
  speedy tractors with hydraulic forks and balers came along, it
  was a different matter&mdash;but this is supposed to be "history."
  Before he retired, Torger did have tractors, and even a "stack

  mover", which could bring a whole stack of hay home at a time! I
  never saw it work.</p>

  <p>Ila read my description of a bucking pole and said she still
  couldn't visualize one. Maybe no one else who has not seen one
  can either. I laid a wide yardstick flat on the table, spaced
  four blocks like Tommy and Rich play with along it, and put
  another yardstick on top for a model. With me on one end and Ila
  on the other as the horses, we slid it along the table and

  "bucked" the sugar bowl and stuff along to the end of it. Then
  she understood the operation, so I thought I better include this
  little description. Ray could have drawn some good (and

  sometimes funny) illustrations for lots of these stories!</p>

  <p>A lot of the hay land was about three miles east of the main
  farm. The sheep were pastured there most of the summer. There
  was a well, a granary, a sheepshed, and I believe an old house on
  that land. At noon the horses were given a rest and fed and
  watered. Someone, usually Thelma, would drive up with a hot
  meal. Of course we carried buckets or boxes along for our
  forenoon and afternoon lunches. Everyone, including the horses
  needed a break, especially on hot stacking days. One team pulled
  a hayrack back and forth, with the rest of the horses needed that
  day tied behind. At night a small load of fresh hay was usually
  tossed on at home for the horses to eat. They were immediately
  unharnessed and led out to roll and have a long drink before
  being fed and bedded down for the night in the old log horse
  barn. Incidentally, the old original log horse barn still stands
  there. Even in the busiest times, the 40 cows had to be milked
  and cared for. They were pastured except at milking if there was
  grass to eat.</p>

  <p>The work days were long! Supper was eaten after milking,
  maybe 8 to 9 o'clock, and then it was time for bed. I always
  slept in the attic while staying out there. Breakfast was after
  the morning milking. A quick cup of coffee was all they needed
  to get that done, so it was about 8 or 9 when breakfast finished.
  That may sound like a late start for haying or field work, but
  the milk cows were the most important. It was usually necessary
  for the morning dew to dry off anyway, especially for haying.</p>

  <p>There were stalls for all the cows, two cows per stall.
  The pipe for the milker ran to all of them, the vacuum cock for

  the milker was between each pair of cows. They all knew their
  places and were eager to be tied in and fed a little and milked,
  and most were quite gentle. The milk wasn't delivered through

  the pipe to the milk room as is done now, but went into a large
  container that had the hoses and teat cups fastened to the lid.
  This was emptied after each pair of cows had filled it, into big
  ten-gallon cream cans with lids. These were carried by hand to
  the separator room where Grandpa Folland took charge. The vacuum
  pump was driven by a small gasoline engine in the barn and its

  exhaust was piped outside. Although well muffled, it could be

  heard well enough around the yard, so everyone knew it was

  running. The cows' udders were all washed first, and they were

  all "stripped" by hand after the milker had done most of the job.
  The milker could get it all, but there was some danger of damage
  to the cow if it were left on too long. After a bit of
  experience a person could feel the cow's udder and tell when she
  was nearly dry. After getting used to the routine and big enough
  to lift the milker and the ten-gallon cans of milk, I did some of
  the milking. I even did it alone on occasion the last year or
  so.</p>

  <p>Mowing was one of the easier jobs for a young boy, and I
  sure did a lot of it. Because of the large amount that had to be
  mowed, two units were usually used. Torger always had six-foot
  machines, and a twelve-foot rake so it could handle two swaths.
  The regular size was five feet with a ten-foot rake. Spare sharp
  sickles, as well as some other parts and tools, were carried
  along in the hayrack. Every night the dull sickles were pulled
  out and taken home to sharpen on the old foot powered grindstone.
  On some of the tough "wire grass", a couple of sharp ones were
  needed in a day. One area "out east" presented a problem with
  rocks, and although some were easy to see and avoid, some were
  well hidden in the grass and would hook the sickle bar and bring
  the mower to a sudden stop. If the rock happened to be at the
  very outer edge of the sickle bar, it could give the mower a very
  sudden twist. At times the seat would jerk sideways from under
  me and I'd find myself sitting on the ground, and not gently
  either! The rocks bothered the bucking operation too, as they
  could stop the hay from sliding properly. The pole would rise
  up over it, and would have to be pulled back and started again.
  That area was never plowed that I remember, but used only for
  hay.</p>

  <p>The home place had few rock problems. Below the topsoil
  which was quite sandy, was all sand and gravel. The water table
  was only about five feet down and it could be tapped by driving a
  "sand point", with a sledge, and a pump screwed on the top. That
  was about a three-foot length of two-inch, screened, perforated
  pipe with a pointed end, and enough pipe could be screwed on the
  top end so it could be driven down into the water-bearing sand.
  Only a limited amount of water could be pumped from it, but there
  was usually enough for household purposes. For livestock, a well
  was dug by hand and the sides cribbed with lumber or sometimes a
  section of steel culvert. A hinged lid was put in the cover so
  it could be used for lowering cans of milk or other perishables
  to keep cool. Sometimes a pump wasn't even used. A pail was
  lowered by a rope, and by flipping it just right, would tip into
  the water and fill up. That took a bit of practice, but wasn't
  really very hard to learn.</p>

  <p>Torger's well by the barn was big enough to hold several
  cream cans and seemed to furnish unlimited water. A gasoline
  engine was used to pump water into a huge wooden tank upstairs in
  the barn, from which it ran to drinking cups in all the stalls,
  the horse trough outside, and to the separator room. The cows
  soon learned to push the lever down in the cup with their noses
  so water would run into it.</p>

  <p>Some of the land not used for pasture or hay was farmed.
  Several acres of potatoes, some oats, barley, wheat and flax were
  raised, most of the oats and barley being used as feed. Rye, and
  winter wheat such as is raised on the big wheat fields of Kansas
  and Oklahoma, was planted in the fall, and it grew some then and
  somehow survived the winter and was ready to appear first thing
  in spring. Sometimes it grew enough in the fall to provide some
  pasture before the snow covered it up. It was ready to harvest
  early the next summer. Then came the oats, spring wheat and
  finally the flax. A little buckwheat was raised in the far north
  too, and when a field of that was in bloom, it had a distinctive
  bad smell that would be carried quite a distance by the wind, so
  a person could tell if there was a field of it in the area. I
  don't remember that Follands ever had any.</p>

  <p>Torger used a binder for all the harvesting and I never
  drove it much as there were so many moving parts to give trouble.
  There were the sickle, canvases, packers and the needle and twine
  and knotter that tied the bundles, and the kicker that pushed

  them out to the carrier. The carrier held them until ten or
  twelve had piled up on it. Then they were dumped in a pile, to
  be shocked by hand, base down in a small cone-shaped circle to
  dry and wait for the threshing crew. It generally took four

  horses to pull the binder.</p>

  <p>Threshing was a big project, and I'm sure everyone has read

  descriptions of those events if not actually being in on any. I
  can barely remember the old steam engine "locomotive" that was
  still in use when we were at Badger. It had huge rear wheels

  about six feet high and over two feet wide to carry the weight.
  It was really a ponderous machine, moving two miles an hour or so
  from farm to farm with the actual threshing machine or grain
  "separator" and a water tank wagon and a hayrack or two behind
  it. It was a real "train" and it had a steam whistle on it that
  sounded like one too. The whistle was used to signal when
  dinner was ready, and when steam pressure was up and it was ready
  to go again.</p>

  <p>Some kindling and firewood and a few sacks of coal were
  carried for fuel, but a lot of straw was also poked in the
  firebox to feed it, once pressure was up. There was usually only
  one in a community and its owner had to be a real engineer and
  mechanic to keep everything in working order.</p>

  <p>The separator was a very complicated affair. A big
  whirling cylinder with replaceable teeth beat up the bundles of
  grain that were carried into it by a wide slatted canvas conveyor
  on the "feeder" that extended from the front for several feet. A
  bundle hayrack was driven up on each side, as close as the
  usually frightened horses could be driven, and each driver took
  turns laying a bundle head first on the feeder. By the time I
  was big enough to help with that at Follands, gasoline tractors
  were used and rubber tires even made their appearance. A lot
  of power was needed to turn the grain separator and keep it at
  proper speed, so a huge flat belt was used. They would stake the

  separator very securely to the ground so it couldn't move and
  level it, and a couple of men would hang one end of the belt over
  the pulley. Then it was unrolled along the ground to the
  tractor, which was eyeballed into a straight position about fifty
  feet or so away. Then they hung the belt on the tractor pulley
  which was backed up to tighten it. The belt was so heavy that it
  had to be pretty tight to lift off the ground, and also to
  provide enough traction. Sometimes the belt was twisted a half
  turn to run the separator in the proper direction. I guess a
  half twist also helped keep it on the pulleys. The first belts
  were of leather, and pieces were laced together with rawhide
  strips. Later the rubberized fabric ones were developed and the
  ends joined by metal fasteners which had teeth that were driven
  through the belt and bent over with a hammer. There were a dozen
  or more smaller belts on a separator too, to drive the shakers
  and fans and augers and the big blower that blew the straw out

  through a big long moveable spout onto the strawsack. One man
  with a pitchfork was needed on the stack to pack and place the
  straw properly so it would shed rain. The separator was placed

  so wind would blow the straw and chaff towards the straw stack
  instead of back at the bundle rack men and grain wagon crews.
  Sometimes the straw would be blown directly into the upstairs of
  a barn so it would stay dry and handy to use for bedding the
  animals. A lot of straw was needed for livestock bedding, and
  oats straw also made fairly good feed for the horses. Straw also
  was used to bank up the foundations of buildings against winter

  weather. Lots of other uses were found for it too. Stacking
  straw was a pretty dirty job, with the straw and chaff and dirt
  being blown right on you. Rye was the worst as it had barbed

  beards that would get into clothes and cause an itchy feeling,
  but someone had to do it.</p>

  <p>Threshing "rings", a group of neighbors pooling their teams,
  bundle racks, and man power and following the rigs from place to
  place as the season progressed were still necessary. The
  housewives in the ring provided the lunches and noon meals, and
  seemed to have a continual contest to see who could provide the

  best eats and get the reputation of being the best cook. Pork
  chops and swiss steak or ham with lots of potatoes and gravy
  seemed to go over best with a hungry threshing crew. Pies of
  different kinds were the usual dessert. There were sandwiches

  and cakes and cookies for lunches. Quite a crew was needed&mdash;six
  or eight teams and bundle racks plus a grain wagon or two with a
  tight box.</p>

  <p>Flax was sometimes sacked directly from the machine, as the
  yield was quite low and a couple of men could keep up with it.
  Sometimes a small amount of flaxseed was saved in the house on
  the home remedy medicine shelf. It was used to make poultices
  for boils that frequently developed on people and livestock in
  those days. We kids frequently would grab a handful of freshly
  threshed wheat to chew. If it was chewed long enough without
  swallowing, the gluten finally formed a kind of chewing gum.
  Although almost tasteless, it was fun to see if we could develop
  a small wad! Real fresh whole wheat cereal&mdash;really whole wheat

 &mdash;was an occasional treat too. A gallon or so of the fresh,
  clean wheat was caught direct from the thresher spout and picked
  over, kernel by kernel and washed. Then a kettle of it was
  soaked overnight. In the morning it was boiled until the
  kernels were swelled and soft, and eaten with cream or sugar. I
  don't remember that any was ground in the coffee grinder, but
  that was probably done too. Everyone had a coffee grinder, as
  the whole beans came to the store in a big sack or barrel and
  were scooped out and sold that way. Most stores had a big

  grinder and would grind it for you, coarse or fine as preferred.</p>

  <p>I forgot to mention a springtime job at Torger's. He would
  buy or select some spuds suitable for planting and they were cut
  into pieces. A very sharp knife was fastened to a board with
  about three or four inches of the blade sticking up. The board
  was nailed to an old wooden table which held a pile of the spuds.
  The operator sat at the end of the board and pulled the potatoes
  across the blade so they were cut in several pieces and drOpped
  in a basket below. The pieces were to contain at least three
  eyes and be big enough to nourish the sprouts until they had
  pushed their way up through the soil to sunlight and developed a
  little root system. Several bushels were needed to plant the
  fifteen to twenty acres they usually had. Planting was done by
  a horse-drawn planter that opened a small furrow and dropped the
  pieces in at regular intervals and then covered and pressed down
  the soil again. They were generally cultivated a couple of times
 &mdash;more if there were lots of weeds and time could be found during
  the haying season.</p>

  <h3><a name="i-remember--the-1930s">THE 1930's</a></h3>

  <p>In the fall of 1931 it was decided that I should go to the
  ag college in Crookston, which was a branch of the University of
  Minnesota. Newell had gone there for three years. It offered
  farm oriented courses for both boys and girls and ran about seven
  months, so kids could be home for both fall and spring work. A
  four year course was supposed to be the equivalent of high school
  and would allow a kid to enter college&mdash;especially the
  University of Minnesota, which was naturally heavily plugged.
  There were dormitories and dining halls and my roommate was a kid
  from Fauna (a school and store and post office near Baudette)

  named Fred Cook. There was a nice gym and indoor swimming pool
  and I learned to swim there. The boys weren't allowed to wear
  trunks or suits. We were herded through the showers and
  inspected every time before we could go in. The showers were
  cold and the pool wasn't heated except by what it absorbed from
  us and the air in the building which was kept warm. The first
  dip was quite a shock. Some kids had to be pushed in at first

  by the instructor, but we were young and soon would rush to dive
  in and get the first icy shock over with.</p>

  <p>One of the upperclassmen was Ed Widseth, who was a huge

  fellow about 6' 4" and 250 pounds. He was on the football team
  there. He later became an All-American tackle on the University

  of Minnesota team under Bernie Bierman. He was by far the
  biggest boy on the campus, and as I was the smallest, I really
  looked up to him. He was a real nice and gentle guy except on
  the football field, and sort of protected us smaller kids, and
  cheered us up when we were homesick. It was my first experience
  away from home. I think I had visits from Thelma and Torger
  and Clara and Harry, and I got home for Christmas, too. Another
  upperclassman friend was Allan Hoff. Imagine our surprise when

  about eleven years later, after being drafted, we found ourselves
  in the same barracks and classes at radio school in Scott Field,
  Illinois! He was a bit older than the rest of us and was squad
  and barracks leader.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 1932 we moved to Karlstad where Sylvia and
  I were able to finish high school. The house was almost next
  door to the northwest corner of the school and there was a barn
  and chicken house and a few acres of lowland pasture and room for
  Papa's big garden. He usually had three cows, and sold the milk
  to people around town. Milk bottles had appeared by that time
  and he built a little two-wheeled cart that Sylvia and I used to
  push around to deliver it with. We also pulled it with a bike
  or carried the bottles in the bike baskets. Runners were put on
  the cart when there was snow. After we graduated and left home,

  Papa had to push the cart himself and kept it up for several
  years.</p>

  <p>One of our teachers for at least the last couple of years at

  Karlstad was Ray Dordal. He was an excellent teacher in every
  subject, but especially in any type of math or English and
  speech, and debate. He was also an extraordinarily good artist
  and cartoonist. I have a copy of the Karlstad paper which
  featured a picture he drew of Papa and a short article about him
  on the front page. I imagine Tess has lot more samples of his
  drawings.</p>

  <p>At Karlstad I was in some declamatory contests and debates,
  and finally graduated in 1935. I was even valedictorian, which
  wasn't too big an honor as there was a grand total of seven
  people, four boys and three girls, in the class! Hardly enough

  to make a 50th reunion a very big affair. We tried to play
  basketball too&mdash;in the Karlstad movie theater when the seats
  were removed. The walls, at least on one side, were the
  sidelines, and the spectators, if any, had to crowd up on the
  stage at one end. There may have been about three feet of space
  along one side. A few people could stand there if they were
  brave and could dodge the ball when someone didn't catch a pass.
  Superintendent Yngve was our coach. There were no showers or
  dressing rooms, so we had to dress in a couple of the cubby hole
  toilets and then dash home all sweaty and wash up a little. I

  don't think many all-state players were developed there, but some
  high schools didn't have a place to play at all in those days.
  It wasn't as big as a regulation court, either, even using all
  the space there was and hanging one basket directly on the wall
  opposite the stage. The ceiling wasn't high enough to allow much

  of an arch if a long shot was attempted. It let us work off
  some youthful energy and I guess that was the main thing.</p>

  <p>One of the players who was surprisingly good for his weight
  was Donald Nordine, or "Lardy" as he was always called for
  obvious reasons. He was the only boy in school who always had a
  car to use, so of course he was everyone's friend. He was also
  a very friendly and good-natured guy. His folks owned Nordines
  Cafe, which maybe is the reason he put on so much lard. He was
  always eating candy bars and was very generous with them. The
  car I remember was a 1934 Pontiac four door and it had a good
  heater and a radio. He drove it all the time except when in
  school, much as lots of the high school kids do here now. In
  this area at least, it seems like all the seniors have pg! cars
  and the streets are crowded with them, driving up and down Main
  street during noon hour, before, and after school. The parking
  lot and streets around the school make a person wonder if there
  is some big event going on that has attracted a big crowd! There

  seems to be no sign of a gas shortage or high prices. Most of
  the cars are pretty sporty ones with huge engines. The kids can
  make the tires squeal when they step on the gas. A lot of the
  kids seem to think that their ecucation is complete if they can
  read and write well enough to sign a check. The authorities
  give them diplomas, too&mdash;maybe to get rid of them. But such

  talk has nothing to do with family history.</p>

  <p>The "basketball" theater was used for showing movies on
  weekends&mdash;in the summer mostly. It was a big deal for kids to
  "go to show". There was usually a two reel comedy&mdash;Laurel and
  Hardy, the Marx Brothers or something, and then a ten or twelve
  reel main show, usually cowboy- type. One year for a couple or
  three months, I was hired to run the projectors, so learned a
  little about that. Talkies had started, and though not too well
  perfected at that time, they had the sound right on the film and
  not on records as had been used previously. The records were
  supposed to be syncronized with the film to make it seem real.
  Two projectors were used, one being loaded (35 mm film) while
  the other was working. Near the end of a reel, a spot of light
  flashed in the upper corner of the picture. As this spot
  changed to a special shape, the freshly loaded projector was
  turned on and triggered at exactly the right time (supposedly) to
  take over the scene and provide continuity. Mostly the shows
  were black and white. Although colored pictures were being run
  in places, the rent was a lot higher for them and our area and
  tiny theater didn't provide crowds big enough to make that pay.
  Sometimes there was a double feature that had the kids all

  begging to "stay for the second show". I got paid a whole dollar
  and a half a nite and two bucks for a double. Of course I got to
  see the show free and sometimes a free bag of popcorn, too. I

  gave it up in favor of working out at Torger's, as soon as the
  novelty wore off.</p>

  <p>I guess everybody who was around in 1936 can remember the

  snow and cold of the winter and the drought and heat of the
  summer after. We had one six week period when the warmest day

  reached a high of ten degrees below zero. (Farenheit, that is.)
  Northern Minnesota always had long, cold winters, but usually
  there was a "January thaw" to give folks a little break and a
  hope of spring someday. I guess now we will also remember the
  heat of '77, and the winter of '78 which was very similar to
  1936, except in 1977 there was lots of air-conditioning and
  instead of cutting more stove wood, the old pocket book was

  flattened by the gas and fuel oil bills. The roads were opened
  most of the time shortly after each blizzard. Even the
  Brownsville, Texas group didn't bask in continual sunshine, and
  it was cold in Georgia and Tennessee. Knoxville was almost

  immobilized by sleet and ice storms at times. The Hill were Doug
  lives was too slippery to drive on, but Rich had a fine time
  playing on it. They would put him in an old dishpan and send him
  whirling and sliding down the street.</p>

  <p>I don't have the exact dates, but in early 1937 I took a
  three month business course at Interstate business college in

  Fargo. Part of that time Sylvia was there too, taking a longer
  secretarial course. I think we stayed at private homes. The
  school had a list of the available ones that furnished "room and
  board". We rode the streetcars to school, although some buses
  had started to appear. I sent my laundry home for Mama to do&mdash;in a cardboard box enclosed in a canvas cover made for the
  purpose. It had a handle and could be carried like a suitcase.</p>

  <p>An envelope-sized pocket on one side was covered with celluloid
  and held the address card, which was merely pulled out and turned
  over to show the proper side. Parcel post was then cheap and
  very dependable. The laundry was delivered on the proper day
  every week like clockwork. Mama used to write us letters often,
  and also send boxes of homemade cookies and candy. Sometimes I'd
  find some in the laundry bag. I guess she missed her "babies."</p>

  <p>My classes had some typing and bookkeeping, and that
  included "rapid cal". That gave helps on figuring short cuts,
  like adding all the same figures in a column by themselves first&mdash;like four eights would be thirty-two and a six and a couple of
  twos would quickly be forty-two. VThis isn't a lesson, but I
  still find it useful, as is reading a sentence instead of reading
  word by word. I sometimes wonder at some of the young store
  clerks who have to reach for their calculator to add three small
  items, or to figure a three per cent sales tax on ten dollars! I
  have a cartoon that Ray drew of me sitting at a high desk with my
  feet wound around a stool and scratching my head over a problem
  in "Rapid cal".</p>

  <p>When I returned to Roseau to work with Archie Lee, he had
  built an enclosure with a high counter under which were the
  filing cabinets etc.. I could sit on a high stool there and do
  the bookkeeping and typing. I was sort of king of the office and
  could see pretty well what was going on through the side windows
  on the north and the big ones in front on the east. I sometimes
  used an electric heater under the counter, too. There was an
  occasional real hot day in summer, but mostly it was pretty nice,
  except for flies and mosquitos.</p>

  <p>After Sylvia and I left home, the upstairs was empty so Mama
  took in a couple of roomers, one of them being Ray Dordal. There
  was a separate oil heater upstairs that they could light when it
  got real cold. It wasn't a very fancy place, but it was so very
  close to school, and the roomers appreciated Mama's efforts to
  make them feel at home. In 1937 when Tess was home from Aitkin
  for Christmas vacation, they had just started washing clothes on
  Tuesday morning, December 21, when Mama fell to the floor in a
  stroke and passed away in a few minutes. It made a sad and empty
  Christmas, but at least she was spared a long period of suffering
  and hospitilization and being bedfast. Orville and his parents,
  Nick and Bea, brought Uncle Alfred and Aunt Mag to the funeral,
  and there were also many other relatives and friends who came
  from a distance to attend.</p>

  <p>All the time I was at Roseau I stayed at Jake and Esther
  Snustad's, where I had a nice room and breakfast for $12.00 a

  month. They were an "elderly" (over 50) couple and had no
  children. He was co-owner and editor of the "Roseau Times
  Region" and she had been a teacher. I'm sure they didn't need
  the money, but they loved having someone around. Besides me,
  they usually had a schoolmarm or two staying there. Even if
  they were in a little older age bracket than I, we all enjoyed
  our breakfast together. I remember the name of only one

  schoolmarm and she was Rachel Townsend.</p>

  <p>Snustad's had a beautiful new home, and we all slept
  upstairs and took turns at the bathroom with no problems. I
  think Esther even did my laundry for a time, but there were other
  ladies in town that "took in" washing for a very small sum.
  White trousers (starched and pressed) and white shoes were the
  style then. Dark wool pants and suits had to be pressed so they
  had a knife sharp crease. I learned to do that myself with a
  small electric iron with a folding handle, that was part of my
  traveling kit. A young fellow wouldn't dream of appearing on a
  Sunday, or on any evening after supper without being "dressed
  up", unless on a fishing trip or such. Girls very seldom were
  caught out in slacks or trousers of any kind unless on an outing
  or picnic. Silk stockings were a problem for the girls too,
  and I guess nylon was a blessing when that was developed. When
  someone thought up panty hose and the girls could do away with
  garters they were happier yet. Wash and wear fabrics have made
  the starching and ironing problems almost disappear, I guess.</p>

  <p>Jake and his partner at the newspaper had a profitable honey
  bee business, which was a "natural" in the "County of Clovers"
  which is how Roseau County publicized itself. They had about six
  hundred colonies, and extracted the honey themselves. They sold
  most of it in sixty pound (about five gallons) square
  containers. By stacking on supers up to six in' number, as
  needed, the hives got pretty tall. At harvest in the fall, when
  they were full, they would yeild up to a hundred pounds of clover
  blossom honey each. I owned six colonies of them and they tried
  to teach me to tend them, but I never had the courage to do much
  of the actual bee work myself.</p>

  <p>Snustad and Grothe did all their own bee tending and could
  transfer queen bees and start new colonies whenever necessary.
  They wore hats with a face and neck net, and tied their sleeve
  and ankle cuffs so the bees couldn't crawl inside the clothing
  where they could be squeezed and were sure to sting in a
  sensitive place. They didn't wear gloves as they hampered the
  work too much. They had a small bellows affair which would emit
  smoke from its nozzle when lit and squeezed, and a whiff of that
  through the hive entrance before taking off the cover seemed to
  calm the insects some. The men developed an immunity and didn't
  mind a sting on their hands any more than we would a mosquito
  bite!</p>

  <p>They had groups of colonies all over the nearby countryside.
  When a group was spotted at the edge of a grove by a field of
  clover, stacked about six or seven feet tall, it was a pretty
  sight. I could say, "Six of those belong to me." I tried to
  get a honey deal started for Papa at Karlstad, but I don't
  remember if we ever got anything actually going.</p>

  <p>All the supers, except the bottom one where the swarm
  actually lived, were taken off in the fall for their honey. As
  the bottom one didn't have enough honey to last over the winter,
  an empty one containing an arrangement which fed them sugar
  solution was put on top of it. Although bees aren't active in
  winter, they aren't completely dormant either and eat enough to
  exist. They keep the queen bee and the hive nice and warm,
  helped by straw piled around, and the snow that finally covers
  them. Sugar was much cheaper than honey, and they seemed to
  accept it. It's fascinating to watch and learn a little about
  their cooperative way of living and making provisions for
  existing when so many things are working against them. Orchard
  growers everywhere know of their value for pollination and try to
  have some hives around. Even the clover farms benefited by
  their work, although big bumble bees had to work some varieties.
  They will go quite a distance for nectar, but will work the
  nearest blossoms if possible, so different flavors of honey are

  produced, depending on location. You all know that clover
  blossom honey is light, golden and mild, but there are others.
  Basswood honey is even lighter colored and very sweet. They
  make a dark kind out of the stinky buckwheat blossoms. It has
  quite a strong taste, but I think it is very distinctive and
  delicious. We used to sample several kinds and never found any
  we didn't like. I guess the bees know what they're doing.</p>

  <p>The big frames containing the honey combs were clamped so
  that a fine wire heated by electricity could be pulled across
  each side and the top caps of wax cut off. Then they were
  whirled in a steam-heated centrifuge and the warmed honey would
  fly out and be drawn off, strained, and put into the big cans.
  The extra bits of wax were saved and melted into molds which were

  then sent somewhere to be pressed into sheets. New frames were
  started as necessary by laying a sheet of wax across the fine
  wire. The wire criss-crossed and gave strength to the frame.</p>

  <p>It was up to the bees to warm up and form the wax into the honey

  cells. There was a good market for excess wax, which the bees
  produced too, but a sheet of wax already there gave them more
  time to make the actual honey.</p>

  <p>I had several different cars while at Archie's. Newell sold
  Pontiac and Archie had the Nash dealership, so one or the other
  usually had some used ones around and would give me a "good
  deal". I remember a green 1935 Chevrolet sedan that had the
  "suicide doors" in front. The latch was at the front and the
  hinges at the rear, so if the door opened while moving, the wind
  would catch it and nearly tear it off. A person who tried to
  catch it and close it, could be pulled right out! They were very
  easy to get in and out of though.</p>

  <p>I often spent weekends at Greenbush or Karlstad, Halma or
  Baudette. I fished at Morris or Wheeler's Point a lot in the
  spring when it was considered "poor" if it took over an hour or
  two to catch a limit of eight walleyes. As Lil and Archie's
  wife, Olga, were sisters, they also visited quite often. Two
  of the other Sunset girls married farmers and lived in the Roseau
  area, and three brothers and families lived there in town.
  Another brother, Ole, was a buttermaker in South Dakota. Ingvard
  is now the Roseau County historian and museum director. Two of
  the other Sunset girls lived and worked in Willmar, Minnesota,
  and I was well acquainted with all of them and their families.
  Much later, Emma and Elmer Hoffman moved near Lewiston,
  Washington. When Margaret Heide Krause and Ron and family lived
  there for a time recently, they often visited with Em, who is
  still there, although Elmer has passed away.</p>

  <p>Archie paid me $100 a month for a year or so. Then I got a
  $10 raise, so I was right up there with the bank clerks and
  others and could afford a "luxury" or two. One of them was an

  eight millimeter movie camera and projector, and I used it a lot
  on the crop of nieces and nephews that had arrived and kept
  arriving for a time. I experimented some too, splicing some
  finished film into a roll backwards so snow would jump off the
  ground onto a shovel or up to a roof top, etc. A lot of the film
  has survived the forty or so years since then. Since getting
  involved with this project, I've found another projector to use,
  and have consolidated and spliced a couple dozen or so old rolls
  onto two-hundred-foot reels, so can run off quite a show of the
  events and kids and people of that date. They have helped
  restore memories and fix the correct dates of several of the
  things I've mentioned, and prove that all of us were younger
  once! I have a few of army life and of my own kids up to the
  time Donna learned to walk, but none any later.</p>

  <h3><a name="i-remember--the-1940s">THE 1940's</a></h3>

  <p>Early in 1940, Newell and Lil were involved in an auto
  accident while returning to Baudette one night. In that area,
  fires in the peat bogs burned all winter in places, and combined
  with patches of fog, the smoke would drift across the highway,

  completely obscuring vision suddenly, and without warning. One
  of these patches caused the accident. Lil was seriously
  injured and hospitalized for quite some time. The fairly new
  Pontiac they were driving was badly damaged, but after being

  repaired, it was sold to me. I drove it for over a year, taking
  several trips in it.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 1940, I took Papa and Sylvia and the girl
  friend of that time, Gladys Olson, along on one of those trips.
  We stopped at Uncle Ole and Aunt Bertha Lee's place at Detroit
  Lakes for a couple of days. We also saw Clarence and Oren, Melba
  and her husband, and Dorothy and her son Peter, who came to
  Detroit Lakes, too. Then we stopped at Glenwood and visited
  Papa's uncle George Aal (his mother's brother) and his daughter
  Charlotte. I understand that Papa and his sister Oline, who was
  four years younger, lived with Uncle George at Glenwood for a
  time (when he was about fourteen or so.) There had been some
  friction between Papa and Oline and their stepmother. Oline
  lived at Glenwood for many years, and we visited her grave there.
  She had passed away at Great Falls, Montana in 1936.</p>

  <p>Then we spent several days with the Minneota relatives, and
  I took Gladys on a side trip to see some of her relatives in
  Redfield, South Dakota. I have a nice 200 ft roll of movies of
  that trip. Sylvia and I were really impressed with the huge
  hills, after having lived on perfectly flat land all our lives.
  We had to use manure piles and straw stacks as "hills" to slide
  on with the skis Papa had once made us. He had also told us many
  times about the big wooden ski slide and jump that was built on
  a hilltop at Glenwood, and sure enough, there it was. We had to
  climb to the top, but Papa didn't.</p>

  <p>Early in the fall of 1940, I got my first (and only) brand
  new car. Archie sold Nash cars, besides International trucks and
  machinery. He had found a buyer who wanted my 1939 Pontiac, so
  we made a deal for a small 1941 two-door Nash 600&mdash;a six
  cylinder flat head. It cost $600 and the Pontiac was included in
  that. I was pretty proud of that car. It had an overdrive,
  reclining front seats, and the back seat cushion could be slid
  forward, the back rest lifted up and hooked to the top, and there

  was a bed. Feet were stuck in the trunk, so there was plenty of
  room to stretch out. I suppose it was the forerunner of today's
  campers. I believe that 1941 was the last year that Nashes were
  built, and due to the war, only a few cars of any make were made
  in 1942. None were made again until 1946 except Jeeps and
  trucks.</p>

  <p>Hitler was starting his crazy doings by 1939 in Poland, and
  the U.S. set up its Selective Service draft board system in

  September of 1940. I had to sign up in the spring of 1941.
  Lenus Landby was the chairman of the board in Roseau County.
  Each board had the power to defer draftees. The draft numbers

  were determined by lottery on the basis of physical and mental
  fitness, value to the country as a civilian worker, or going to

  college, etc.. I was examined by Dr. Delmore on August 22, 1941
  and was temporarily deferred because I was so near-sighted.</p>

  <p>At first the people who worked in defense plants were
  usually deferred. Hoping for additional deferment, I left for
  California. On the basis of aptitude tests, I got a job at a
  Lockheed aircraft plant in Burbank that turned out the beautiful
  twin engined and twin tailed liquid cooled P38 "Lightening"
  fighter planes. Their two big V-12 Allison engines could gulp
  huge amounts of fuel for the power they delivered to the
  propellers. Although a formation of them looked very fierce and
  beautiful, the need for Prestone coolant was one of their many
  problems and I don't believe they were too successful.</p>

  <p>I was classified as a "tool crib" attendant, which meant I
  was one of three people who worked in a small enclosure by the
  assembly line. The actual line workers checked out drill motors,
  rivet guns and all sorts of tools which they had to turn in at
  the end of their shifts. We kept all sorts of tools, all
  numbered and "filed" according to some supervisor's master list.
  That was my first and only experience working for a big company
  that was doing government work on a "cost plus" basis, and boy
  there was plenty of cost. The bigger it got, the more profit
  they made. In spite of being a supposed all-out war effort, the
  waste and loafing and oversupply of help was unbelievable to me
  at first. There were dozens of government and company inspectors
  standing around, and most of them didn't know as much as I did

  about putting an airplane together. How they ever got finished
  and actually flew is surprising, but fly they did. If many
  crashed, noone heard about it. The test pilots were a really

  brave gang of young men!</p>

  <p>Quite a few women worked in the plant too, and some of you
  may remember the song "Rosie the Riveter." We had a fairly young
  divorcee in our tool crib. She had two small kids, and really
  needed the job. I worked the "swing shift" from 4 pm to midnight
  and was paid a bit more than the day shift&mdash;nearly three bucks
  an hour. That left me time in daylight to visit relatives and

  see the sights and suited me fine. My whole trip and stay
  were quite an experience. As I had no timetable when driving
  out, I spent about two weeks on the trip, making a few stops and
  detours to see the sights, etc. "Bake" Olson had already been
  drafted and was with an infantry outfit in Wyoming where I spent
  one weekend. Then I spent a couple of days in Yellowstone Park
  and also around Salt Lake City. I slept in the bed in my car. I had made screens for the rear windows to keep out the insects,
  so it was real cozy and cheap.</p>

  <p>In L.A. I soon found Alton Gould, his lovely wife Helen, and
  their children Diane and Gary. I got real well acquainted with
  them, parking in their driveway and sleeping there for several
  nights. I also visited there quite often during my entire stay
  in the west. A1 got me some maps and showed me how to get
  around. I found Marjorie Gould and her husband Ed Neville and
  their two kids Lavan (Dolly) and Bruce. I visited there a lot

  too. Lillian Gould had died in 1940. Dorothy Lee Frankson, her
  husband Ben and their kids Sigrid and Peter, lived quite a
  distance from the Goulds, in North Hollywood, but as that was
  near Burbank where the Lockheed plant was, I visited them often
  too.</p>

  <p>After getting a job, I found another kid my age and we
  rented a "sleeping cabin" near the plant. I stayed there the
  rest of my time in L.A.. It was one of about ten in a
  "courtyard", and like hundreds of others, had been built to house
  the thousands of defense workers who had arrived. The cabin was
  made of wallboard nailed on a few two-by-fours, and had concrete
  floors. It was liveable only because of the mild climate.
  That's all there was, and lots of houses weren't built much
  better. They still aren't I guess, except they may look better.
  I really enjoyed that time in L.A., seeing the sights and getting
  to know the relatives. Fortunately, I took a few movies of them
  and they are still okay.</p>

  <h3><a name="i-remember--air-force-years">AIR FORCE YEARS</a></h3>

  <p>That all came to an end, with the mail bringing a nice
  little card from the draft board (I still have it), ordering me
  to report to a doctor on Whittier Blvd. in L.A. for the army
  entrance physical on September 2, 1942. I passed that, and as
  my job didn't rate a deferment, I merely had to mark time until
  my time came to report for duty. That came soon after and I
  drove back to Minnesota more quickly than going out to L.A.. I
  had another physical at Roseau by Dr. Delmore. (He was called a
  "butcher" by Newell who always remembered when he cut out Tess's
  tonsils and sent her home by train to Badger at once and she
  nearly bled to death.) By that time he was a rich cantankerous
  cigar-chewing old boy who drove a "Lincoln Zephyr" which was a V-12 and had lots of power and a two speed rear axle which could
  take it a hundred miles an hour when and if it would shift to

  high. I'm sure it would be a real collector's item if it still
  existed now. At any rate, my being near-sighted didn't matter
  any more.</p>

  <p>On October 19, 1942, I set out with a group for Fort
  Snelling. As the draft board stated in a letter I have, they had
  "special confidence in my integrity and ability" so I was
  appointed the assistant leader, which I'm glad didn't amount to
  anything. After a few days of more tests, indoctrination, etc. a
  whole troop trainload of us was sent to the Air Force basic
  training grounds at Miami Beach on November 7, 1942. There we
  lived in a row of cheap hotels that the Air Force had taken over
  and were issued the light khaki cotton summer uniforms that were
  washed and pressed and starched the G.I. way.</p>

  <p>We were tested and marched and drilled and inspected and
  they decided to send me and lots of others to radio operators'
  and mechanics' school at Scott Field, Illinois. At first we were
  all impressed by actually being in Miami Beach with its formerly

  brilliantly lit up string of hotels and amusement spots, and the
  warm sunny weather, but a few days of marching and drilling in
  the sun soon made us wish for a little Minnesota climate again.
  The hotels had lost their glamor too, as they were really only
  wallboard and plaster shacks that the mild weather allowed them
  to build.</p>

  <p>The trip down there was my first of several rides by troop
  train and wasn't exactly what one would prefer to take on
  vacation. It was also my first look at a lot of new country.
  From the train, Georgia was mostly a long rough ride over the
  rocky red soil. It was covered with nothing but a lot of brush
  and small evergreens with a spot of cultivated land with an old
  shack on it here and there. Now all those little pines have
  grown into forests of harvesting size, and lumber and pulpwood
  have become one of Georgia's leading resources. This is the
  reason why forestry has become an important study at the
  University of Georgia at Athens. Northern Georgia at least, is
  now all green or bluish with hills and small mountains covered
  with pine forests. The Appalachian Trail starts there at
  Springer Mountain in northern Georgia. A person so inclined can
  hike from there along a marked trail along the crests of the
  Great Smokies in North Carolina, then the Blue Ridge range
  through Virginia and Pennsylvania and the Berkshires, and Green
  and White ranges of New England&mdash;for 1995 miles. It must be a
  wonderful and scenic trip, but I'm content to let someone else
  take it, at least on foot. There are camp sites and shelters
  along the entire length, for hardy people who try to hike it, or
  parts of it.</p>

  <p>Back to the Air Force. After the first week or so in Miami
  Beach, we were allowed passes to leave the area, so every time we
  could, we would try to see the sights. There was the actual
  beach to see, and we also took some scenic boat rides along the
  many canals and passages along the coast. We tried as much as
  possible to enjoy our enforced stay down there.</p>

  <p>About December 5 we got shipped by troop train again to the
  big Air Force Technical Training Command school at Scott Field,
  Illinois, about thirty miles east of St. Louis. Except for
  wartime, military discipline, eats and uniforms, it was a lot
  like college, I suppose, with bare barracks for dormitories.
  They even published a class year book, like the high school
  seniors do, and my picture is in mine, with the other guys in

  Classes 29 and 30. It was a huge place, with a mess hall that
  fed six thousand at a time. The hospital area had fifty-two
  buildings, including X-ray, special units, nurses and medics
  quarters, etc.. The airfield itself was big, with lots of
  hangars and planes and runways. We spent a wet and sloppy winter
  there and though there wasn't much snow, it was raw and cold and
  rained a lot. We were even issued fleece-lined leather flight

  line suits which were warm enough, but keeping shoes all shined
  and the bare barracks floor scrubbed up after wading in mud was
  quite a chore.</p>

  <p>We studied basic radio mechanics and procedure, and learned
  the Morse Code. After seeing samples of my typewriter work, can
  you imagine that I once passed a test in taking Morse Code over
  earphones, typing it directly, at a rate of thirty words a
  minute? At any rate, on April 22, 1943, our class graduated and
  I was one of five who made it "with distinction" and got a
  special diploma signed by some Major General Martin. I got a
  raise in rank to Corporal which meant a pay raise of about twelve
  bucks a month.</p>

  <p>St. Louis people treated the 6.1.5 real well. There were
  tours to take as well as a museum, and Forest Park Zoo. The
  animals were all loose in their own areas and not caged or even
  fenced. It was built in such a fashion that there were overhangs

  or creeks or waterfalls that kept them in without appearing to.</p>

  <p>There were some U.S.O. places where we could bed down and
  chow down and the army also had a small camp in town with some
  ten or twelve man shelters to sleep in when the weather was
  suitable.</p>

  <p>About the end of April a group of us, who the Air Force had
  determined by its testing methods to be likely to be of help in
  that area, was sent to their "top secret" Radar school at Boca
  Raton, Florida. The Millionaires' Club had been taken over and
  we were housed in some pretty classy places and given security
  checks and all that. After a couple weeks there, I got my first
  furlough and it really felt good to get away from it all for a
  few days, even if it meant a long train ride through Georgia and
  all the rest of the way again. Newell got me in on a real good
  "first of the season" fishing trip, and we got our limit of
  walleyes at Wheelers Point in just a short time. We did some
  Paul Bunyan eating when Lil fried them. We had a big family
  gathering at Greenbush, and that's when I got the movies of the
  whole gang getting out of a little coupe. We had a big picnic at
  Lake Bronson too, and were joined there by some of Harry's family
  and his mother.</p>

  <p>We were only at Boca Raton about two months, and it was
  sweltering&mdash;but we got some fun on the beaches there and at Fort

  Lauderdale and the fancy pools at the Boca Raton club. At this
  time the big club is classier and more exclusive and expensive
  than ever. One of the big pro golf tournaments is held there.</p>

  <p>Just as our outfit had been sent to McDill Field, just out
  of Tampa at Lakeland, Florida, I got an emergency furlough to go
  home for Papa's funeral, which was on August 10, 1943. After
  getting back to McDill our outfit had the first experience
  actually doing what we had learned in radio and radar school. I
  never actually did any work with code. We checked out the radio
  sets in certain places with the control tower every morning, to
  be sure all the channels worked so the pilots had voice contact
  with the control tower and the other planes in the squadron. The
  planes we had then were all P.51 Mustangs, and I never saw a

  P.38 like they assembled when I worked for Lockheed at any time
  while I was in the service.</p>

  <p>Lakeland (McDill Field) wasn't too bad a place, and there
  were quite a few interesting sights to see around Tampa. We were

  only there about three months. Our entire squadron was sent to
  Galveston for the winter. I had caught some kind of 'flu bug and
  spent a couple of weeks in the hospital at McDill. After the

  first miseries were over, I rather enjoyed that, as there weren't
  any drills or inspections or floors to scrub, and the food was
  pretty good. Then I got special orders to rejoin my squadron
  which was already in Galveston, on November 30, 1943. I went by
  rail and got 38 cents cash per day in advance for rations for two
  and two thirds days for the journey!</p>

  <p>By that time several of us had been together since Boca
  Raton, so we were pretty good friends, and I have kept in touch
  with two or three of them ever since. We enjoyed the winter
  there, seeing most of the island and beaches and going to the
  mainland at times too. The main attraction of that was just
  going over the long causeway! It did get cold at times on the
  airfield, and I remember wearing the leather fleece lined suit at
  times when the cold wind blew in.</p>

  <p>In May, 1944, we were all shipped to Strother Field near
  Winfield, Kansas. The pilots (who were rapidly shipped overseas
  as their skills improved and were replaced by new ones) got a
  bunch of P.47 planes, a fast single seat fighter with a huge
  radial air-cooled engine. They were able to carry big machine
  guns and several bombs underneath, plus the heavy radar sets we
  had learned to service besides the regular voice radios with the
  push button channels. The radar sets were never left in the
  planes, but taken out and locked up at all times when not in the
  air. They took a lot of current, so a 24 volt generator (gas
  engine powered) was always wheeled out and plugged into the plane
  when testing. It was all done according to official Air Force
  procedure, and there were no "short cuts" allowed at any time.</p>

  <p>Winfield wasn't a very big town, about ten or twelve
  thousand, and the air base wasn't very big either, compared to

  McDill or Galveston. It is in the very south of Kansas, about
  forty miles south of Wichita and about fifteen miles from the
  Oklahoma border. It was a friendly place for G.I.s and so was

  Arkansas City, which was almost on the border, and a little
  bigger. They both had good U.S.O.s to visit too, but no historic

  or scenic places. I had finally got three stripes of buck
  sergeant on my sleeve (which I never surpassed) so I got about 72
  bucks on pay day every month. We called that "Eagle day", when

  Uncle Sam's Eagle would fly over and drop the payroll along with
  other goodies that birds drop!</p>

  <p>I was lucky to have a fellow named George Shuerman as my
  best friend. His mother and brother lived on their farm near
  Ponca City, Oklahoma, about forty or fifty miles from Winfield.
  As he was by then a Master Sergeant, he was allowed to keep his

  '41 Chevy on the base, and had plenty of ration tickets for gas.
  He could nearly always get us both a weekend pass. We spent a lot
  of weekends at his home, enjoying his mother's cooking and even
  going on some night time coon hunts. He had two or three good
  coon hounds. Down there they considered it the very best of
  sports to listen to and follow the dogs on a coon's trail and
  hear their final chorus when they got one "treed." They
  considered it music, but I couldn't quite hear any good close
  harmony to it. It was fun in a way, and surely a lot different
  than anything I'd ever done before!</p>

  <p>Winfield had a large hospital, and the nurses were a
  favorite target on nights when we were out "tom catting" around.
  I got acquainted with a cute little one who was the head of the
  obstetrics division, and George and I were soon seeing her and a

  friend of hers on a pretty regular basis. She had an Iowa farm
  background and was half Norwegian with the very Norwegian name of
  Ila Gulbranson. We hit it off pretty well, and had a lot of

  things in common to talk about. At any rate, a romance blossomed
  and after thirty-three years is still alive, even if the four
  children it produced are all grown up and have left home!</p>

  <p>On May 17, 1945, the German armies signed an unconditional
  surrender, so the "heat" was off after to train the fighter
  pilots. Several of us were sent to an air base at La Junta,
  Colorado, near Pueblo, as Strother Field began closing
  operations. The field was quite small, as was the town, and we
  really didn't have a lot of work to do. We were able to get
  quite a few passes. After looking over the local scenery, and
  nearby Rock Ford (a fertile valley known for its canteloupe and
  muskmelon crops), we were able to take some scenic weekend trips.
  We got to Colorado Springs, up Pike's Peak, and took as many
  small side trips as we could manage.</p>

  <p>About mid-summer, they began forming some radar teams of
  three men in each. I guess it was because they didn't have
  anything else for us to do. We were sent to school again. I was
  sent with several others to Camp Edison, New Jersey for a short
  time and then to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey for two or three more

  months of radar school. This time it was to study the Navy
  radar system which was used on ships to prevent collision with
  other ships, or rocky shores, etc. These units had a rotating

  antenna in a big tub on the tallest mast of a ship, and had
  ranges up to fifty miles or so, in steps down to only several

  hundred yards. This scanned the area, and it showed objects on
  the water or shore on a T.V. screen about a foot in size, very
  like we now see being used to show weather conditions. The sweep

  hand went around the screen like a clock hand, leaving a glowing
  trace of any object that reflected back the radar waves being
  sent out.</p>

  <p>One of the guys on my radar team was Bob Kovar of Boston.
  With him as a guide we made several trips to New York City to see
  the sights. He was well acquainted with the area, so was a big
  help, and I have kept in touch with him every Christmas. We even

  discovered that at one time, a local farmer's daughter from Alta
  who taught school in his area, had his daughter in first or
  second grade in the early 1950's. She was a Huseman from
  Hanover, and she and her husband Ron Neulieb now have the old
  family farm there. I also got a chance to get to Washington D.C.
  in the middle of October. 1945. and visit Siv and Tess and
  Maxine, when they lived at 118 Wayne Place S.E.. Ray was
  somewhere in the Navy, I'm not quite sure just where.</p>

  <p>In November 1945, we finished the radar course and our team
  was sent to Fort Lawton in Seattle. It was then&mdash;just after
  three full years in the Air Force&mdash;I got my first ride in an Air
  Force plane and it was a long one too! We left from a small base
  near Camp Kilmer and stopped about every five hundred miles or so
  to refuel. I don't remember just where, as most times we weren't
  even given a chance to get off and walk around. The plane was an
  old twin engine D.C.3, with benches along the sides and we sat on

  our bags and only had small portholes to look out. It was only
  a cargo plane, and I guess that is exactly what we were. It was
  cold and noisy and rattled all over. It wasn't even insulated.

  We stopped at Billings, Montana long enough to eat, and then
  again at Spokane, where they put on all the fuel they could for
  the jump over the mountains to Seattle.</p>

  <p>Fort Lawton was a sort of temporary camp right on the edge
  of Puget Sound and was a sort of holding place for the G.I.s who
  were being shipped in and out of the country. It was practically
  inside the hilly and scenic city of Seattle. We had learned to
  use every chance we had to leave the base and see the sights, and
  Seattle really does have some wonderful scenery. I can remember
  some ferry boat rides across Puget Sound, and a boat trip to
  Tacoma too. I also managed to get a furlough, and worked in a
  visit to see Ila in Alta, and the Elmer Heide family in Boise,
  Idaho, where Elmer sold and installed insulation. We had also
  become acquainted with a Norwegian family (named Johnson) and our
  three man radar team had our Christmas at their home. They were
  really transplanted Minnesotans, and we had as nice a time as one
  could hope for away from his own home!</p>

  <p>We didn't have to do much at Fort Lawton except wait for
  assignment and go to an occasional refresher class on the radar
  sets used on ships. Finally, about the end of January we were
  put on a ship, the U.S.S. Etolin. It was an old Norwegian cargo
  vessel and had been taken over by the U.S. for use as a troop
  transport. The cargo space had been lined with bunks to carry
  about six hundred troops. It wasn't very large, about four
  hundred feet long. The radar antenna was installed in a sort of
  tub at the top of the tallest mast. The screen and other radio
  stuff was on the bridge, where we could call in the captain or
  navigation officer if needed. We could see and hear whatever was
  going on, and what their plans were, which was real interesting
  in itself.</p>

  <p>We stayed on board for a couple of weeks, tied up to a dock
  right in Seattle harbor. We were instructed in the procedure and

  trouble shooting etc. of the radar set. That included climbing
  the mast and into the tub with the antenna rotor, and from there
  we had a wonderful view of Seattle, the ships in the area and
  harbor, and got a pretty good idea of the whole layout. We were
  given a small stateroom, and ate in the officers' mess, although
  after they were through, so we got pretty good meals. We were
  given pretty much the run of the ship, except the private
  quarters of the officers and crew, and the engine room, which we
  only saw once, on our first guided tour of it. I would have
  liked to see it when the engines were running.</p>

  <p>One little incident happened while we were tied up at the
  dock in Seattle. A couple of Army M.P.s drove down the dock near
  the ship and left their Jeep there while they went on a foot
  patrol down another pier. As soon as they were out of sight, the
  ship's Army doctor and one of its officers (they had both been in
  overseas combat and were wise in the ways of appropriating what
  they wanted) drove the Jeep alongside the ship. As it had one
  of its big booms working loading supplies, they drove it onto a
  cargo net and had it picked up and lowered into the deepest of
  the ship's holds. When the M.P.s came back, no one had seen the
  Jeep, and the poor guys left, obviously in trouble and due for a
  statement of charges for the jeep's value at the very least.
  When we were out at sea later, they had it brought up on deck,
  and painted it grey, with Navy insignia on it. They drove it
  across and all over the Panama Canal Zone, while the ship made
  its slow trip through the canal, and again had its use in New
  Orleans as an "Official" vehicle, with the Navy even furnishing
  fuel! I have a snap shot of it that we took while it was being
  painted.</p>

  <p>The orders for the ship to move finally came, and we were
  towed out into Seattle Harbor, and steered out to sea by a local
  pilot who knew the way. He was taken off by launch, and we
  started out on our own about the first week in February. We were
  to procede to the Panama Canal Zone to pick up six hundred troops
  who were there for some reason&mdash;perhaps stranded there by a ship
  that couldn't go through&mdash;we never found out. We were generally
  out of sight of land, but never far enough not to see it on
  radar. It was cold and windy for a time and we got pretty scared
  of climbing into the radar tub every morning to check it, but
  after a few days it got calm and warm, and we had nothing much to
  do except sun bathe. We only went twelve to fifteen miles an
  hour so we were out a couple of weeks.</p>

  <p>At Panama we were quarantined overnight and inspected, and
  then spent a long but interesting day going through the canal. A
  trained pilot took command and at the three locks we were towed
  by locomotives on each side. At Gatun Lake (man made and the
  water from it is used to fill the locks when ships are raised in
  them to the next level) the pilot steered and used the ship's

  power. It is about twenty miles long, and fed by damming up a
  river. The water level is about 85 feet above the Atlantic and
  Pacific. Tides of the Pacific rise and fall about ten feet more

  than the Atlantic, so the amount a ship is lifted or lowered will

  vary at different times of the day. It was a very educational
  part of the whole trip, and a day I'll always remember.</p>

  <p>The trip from the canal to New Orleans took a few days and
  the Gulf was blue and beautiful. We saw some small whales and
  lots of flying fish. At first we wondered what bluebirds were
  doing out there. Their wings are so transparent they looked blue
  as we looked through them at the water as they glided over it.
  Then when we saw them dive in, we finally realized what they
  were! Most were quite small, but sometimes there were real
  flocks or "schools" of them.</p>

  <p>When we came to the Mississippi, a pilot again came out and
  took over for the fairly long trip through the delta channels.
  We docked at New Orleans. After a couple days we were taken to
  Jackson Barracks and stayed there several more days. We had
  arrived just as the Mardi Gras was starting, which goes on for
  two weeks just before Lent. Catholics the world over have some
  type of Mardi Gras celebration so they can let off steam before
  the time of religious programs and self denial before Easter, but
  the one at New Orleans is regarded as the world's biggest and
  wildest. The war was over and this one was the biggest in
  several years. Most of us had enough "points" to get our
  discharges so we were merely waiting for the orders to come
  through so we could leave the Air Force. We had plenty of time
  to go all over the city and see everything we could. The whole
  place was as crowded as the midway at a state fair, so after a
  little of that we went around to see the old historic sights and
  places. I even have a snap of the "Streetcar Named Desire", but
  can't remember if I actually rode on it. We rode on lots of
  streetcars, as it was the only easy way to get around besides
  walking.</p>

  <p>Finally the orders arrived and I was sent with several
  others by train to Camp McCoy, Wisconsin and got there on March
  13, 1946. At amazing speed for the Army, we were processed. I
  got my discharge, which is dated March 15, 1946, so I was
  actually in service about three and a half years, having left
  Roseau for Fort Snelling on October 19, 1942.</p>

  <h3><a name="i-remember--early-married-years">EARLY MARRIED YEARS</a></h3>

  <p>I had saved up quite a fortune from my huge salary after

  three and a half years of free board and room. After a quick
  trip to Roseau, Baudette, Greenbush, Halma, and Larimore, I
  dashed back to Alta and got married on April4, 1946. By

  coincidence that is Lillian Heide's birthday, and Doug nearly
  made that date too, as he arrived on April 2, 1947.</p>

  <p>Ila had been working at a local doctor's office and as she
  was well acquainted in her home town, she had made arrangements
  with a local spinster (who was then working as a sort of local
  practical nurse) for a room and kitchen and other privileges in
  her house. Ava, Ila's sister who is about a year younger, and

  Ray Post had been married in the fall of 1939. He had spent his
  time in service in the Navy and had gotten home before I did.
  They were living in a trailer house, which they sometimes moved
  to be near his job. He was then a mechanic on large machinery
  which his boss used on road construction projects.</p>

  <p>Through the Veteran's Administration and G.I. Bill, I got a
  job with the city of Alta in the light, water and heating plant.
  The V.A. paid part of the wages in "on the job training." Alta
  had for many years furnished heat, water, and electricity to all
  of the Main Street business places plus most nearby houses.
  Water was heated by up to three coal fired boilers and pumped
  through the town. The rates were based on the number and size
  of the radiators in each place. A lot of the electricity was
  generated by a big old one cylinder steam engine, and the hot
  exhaust then also used to boost the temperature in the city heat
  system. It was really a pretty efficient system at one time. Use
  of electricity soon had exceeded the capacity, so a three
  cylinder two cycle Fairbanks Morse diesel generator was also
  used. In summer the boilers were shut down, and a hook up with
  the R.E.A. was made to take care of peak loads.</p>

  <p>While I was there, a big eight cylinder in line 1400 horse
  power diesel was installed and the town was pretty self
  sufficient for a time. The heating system was already pretty old
  and full of scale and rust. As the pipes were underground,
  maintenance was a problem and was finally dropped altogether in
  January, 1955. My main job for a couple of winters was shoveling

  coal into the boilers and then hauling out the ashes. It was a
  twenty four hour a day operation. I got my share of all night
  shifts, and it was hard and dirty work. Summers were pretty

  good, rebuilding water meters, calibrating electric meters and
  then reading all the meters every month. I got to know everybody
  in town and knew what their basements looked like as that's
  where the water meters were.</p>

  <p>In his off time, Roy had fixed up the hog house on the
  Gulbranson farm and started repairing cars and tractors there. I
  began helping too, and we soon had a pretty good spare time
  business from local farmers. As pg new cars and few tractors had
  been built from 1942 to 1946, everything was in need of
  overhauling. We could see that the situation would continue for
  a while, so we pooled what little resources we had and formed a
  partnership. Then in October, 1948, with help from Ila's folks
  and the bank, we bought the building that I am now in on Main
  Street. It had a small apartment in back and Roy and Ava lived
  in the apartment for years, until their kids started arriving.
  We went to a Lincoln welding school when Roy bought an engine
  driven electric welder and had side jobs for the gas company in
  Storm Lake and Cherokee, welding natural gas lines. This led to
  pretty steady summer work for Roy, while I stayed at the shop.
  We eventually bought some digging machinery and contracted with
  the gas company to extend a lot of lines in Storm Lake, Cherokee
  and Alta. We also repaired and replaced existing ones.</p>

  <p>It was claimed at that time (in 1954 when gas first came to
  Alta) that it was positively the fuel of the future, and was
  cheap and <span class="emphasis">inexhaustable</span>. Well it has certainly been a big
  convenience, and was pretty cheap for a while but&mdash;</p>

  <h2><a name="letters">Letters</a></h2>

  <p>This passage is taken from a letter written by Dad
  on Monday, January 2, 1978. It was sent in the Round
  Robin, the Lee family group letter.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      "Of course I enjoy hearing that you like my letters, but all I really do is visit with you all, and try to say things that are interesting. Maybe I see things on trips that interest me and that I tell about, that wouldn't occur to someone else to even mention. I think I really detect an ulterior motive in all that praise though, so you can get me to write a little family history. You can't get out of it that easily though, as I've thought up a few questions that I've listed on a separate sheet&hellip;If you write things down as you think of them, pretty soon I'll have lots of stuff to put together&hellip;Some will remember things that others don't&hellip;
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, if you all write answers to these, and other things that come to mind, we might get some of the stuff down on paper, and then we'll all have fun reading and remembering, and maybe the grandchildren will even believe some of it!"
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The following are the histories sent from the
  brother and sisters in response to Dad's letter.</p>

  <h3><a name="letters--newell-orlando-lee">NEWELL ORLANDO LEE</a></h3>
  <p>February 16, 1978</p>

  <p>Our dad as a young man taught a country school near
  Minneota. He had graduated from Marshall High School and had a
  year at Valparaiso University. Our mother as a young girl lived
  with her parents on a farm about four miles north of Minneota.
  She had been a student at the school Dad taught. They fell in
  love and they were married at the Orsen farm in 1899. Dad owned

  a small eighty acre farm a few miles south of Minneota in Norland

  township where they lived a couple of years and where I was born.
  (July 5, 1900.)</p>

  <p>They moved to Minneota where Dad managed an elevator. He
  was also Policeman and light and water manager. During these
  years five girls were born. Gladys lived only about nine months.
  I remember her very well and loved her and was broken hearted
  when she died. Mother was not very well. She had been to
  Milwaukee to an ear specialist but did not receive much help.
  She also had an appendix operation right at home. A doctor was
  brought in from Sioux Falls. She was in bed about three weeks.
  Quite different from now. As a little boy I spent a lot of time
  at Grandpa's farm and talked mostly Norwegian.</p>

  <p>Our Grandpa Lee lived on a farm near Coleman, South Dakota,
  and I remember going there by train. Grandpa had married a widow
  with three boys, Irvin, Elmer, and Ingulf Leeland. Grandma and
  Grandpa had two children, Otto and Winnie. We liked them all and
  had fun at their farm. The first Grandma Lee had died when Dad
  was a teenager.</p>

  <p>Our dad's sister Oline lived at Glenwood and made several
  visits. She bought me my first icecream sundae. Very good and a
  real treat. Some of our family friends were&mdash;0.G. Anderson
  (owner of the Big store), Kiles, Newell Dahls, Gunder Bjornson,
  Gislason, Werpeys, Stangelands, Guivets, and many others. Ole
  Lees also lived there then too.</p>

  <p>Walter Gislason interested Dad in Roseau County. He took
  him to Fox, sold a hundred and sixty acres of land to him on the
  old sand ridge and also helped him to get a contract to teach the

  Fox school. Dad came back, loaded an immigrant car with all our
  belongings including a cow and calf, and left for Fox. It took
  several days. He lived in the car.</p>

  <p>Mother and the four girls and I took the train from Marshall
  and arrived in Fox September 7, 1909. A twelve year old girl, Io
  Gislason went with us as her family had moved to Badger and she
  had stayed in Minneota with relatives a while. I remember that
  Io had peanut butter sandwiches and I had never heard of them, so
  I traded one of mine for her peanut butter sandwich so I could
  taste it. I still like them. When we got to Greenbush the train
  stopped for twenty minutes so I got off and strolled on the
  platform. I saw my first team of oxen. They were lying down and
  I thought that was funny. When we got to Fox Dad was there and

  he was glad to see us all and we were glad to see him. He had a
  boy named Adolf Larson with him and he walked with us to our new

  (log cabin) home. All very exciting.</p>

  <p>We lived at Fox three years. We had fun picking berries and
  nuts, climbing trees, hunting partridges and rabbits. Quite a
  life for a small boy, and for the girls too.</p>

  <p>We then moved to Haug (1912) where Dad taught school. We
  lived on a small farm and had a few cows, and a pony (Gary) and
  some chickens and geese. The girls didn't like the geese. We
  had Norwegian parochial school but I rode the pony and only came
  to school at recess and noon to play ball. That didn't go too

  well at home but the folks let me get by with it. They said if I
  hated it so much, they didn't think it would benefit me much.</p>

  <p>After a couple of years at Haug we moved to Halma where Dad
  taught school. He bought forty acres and we raised some
  potatoes. Had some chickens and cows, and a nice team of horses,
  Dick and Fly. Fly was good riding horse. Here I finished eighth
  grade and was confirmed in the Halma church. I played some
  baseball in the summer. I went to the ag college at Crookston
  and graduated from the three year course.</p>

  <p>The folks moved back to Badger. I had worked on a farm rat
  Shelly, Minnesota, and as I had registered for the draft, I
  decided to visit relatives at Minneota and Grandpa at Coleman.
  When at Coleman I was ordered to report at Roseau for induction
  into the Army. However when I got as far as Crookston,
  November 11, the armistice was signed and I did not have to
  report. I then decided to finish my high school course at Badger
  and with good help from teachers I made up work and graduated.</p>

  <p>During the years we lived at Halma a little boy was born so
  I had a brother along with my four sisters. Later a little girl
  (Sylvia) came along to gladden our hearts. When Allan first saw
  her in his crib he said, "That little kid can have my crib but
  she can't have my high chair." Dad worked at taking down the old
  schoolhouse and we used the lumber to build a nice house on the
  farm he had bought two miles west of Badger. We moved to the
  farm, bought some cows and four horses, and started farming. Dad
  taught the Haug school again and drove a school bus. I worked at
  home for about three years, but farming was not good so I decided
  to do something else. I went to Minneota, worked on a farm and
  picked corn in the fall. I went to Mankato Business College and
  finished an accounting and banking course in two years. I got a
  job with Lampert Lumber company as a junior auditor, but after
  nine months I got the job in the Badger Bank, which I had until
  1933 when the bank holiday closed it. I was married to Lillian
  Sunset about three years after coming to Badger. We have one
  adopted daughter, Susan, who is married to James Kent West and
  has two children, Jeffrey, seventeen, and Jennifer, fifteen.
  They live near Anoka and have a very fine home. We visit them as
  often as possible and the children have spent two weeks with us
  each summer.</p>

  <p>After the bank closing, I got a job at the Citizens' State
  Bank at Roseau. They took over the assets of the Badger Bank,
  and I helped liquidate them. We did well too, as we paid off one
  hundred percent of the deposits.</p>

  <p>In 1935 I bought the International Harvester Co. contract at
  Baudette, and we moved up there. We closed the business in 1962,
  and I ran for County Treasurer. I had quite a race but made it
  and am still on the job which is now in my sixteenth year.

  I do not have much information on our Lee family after I
  left home, but some of the others can fill that in.</p>

  <h3><a name="letters--thelma-olivia-lee-folland">THELMA OLIVIA LEE FOLLAND</a></h3>

  <p>I, Thelma Olivia, was born in a remodeled schoolhouse in
  Minneota in 1902, February 2nd, on a Sunday, and baptized three

  weeks later. Later we moved to another house in Minneota, and
  lived there until we moved to Fox, Minnesota.</p>

  <p>When I was seven years I remember jumping rope all the way
  to school at times. Also going to my cousin Melba Lee's birthday
  party and giving her a gift. It was a pretty little plate. I
  fell on the way to her house, and broke the plate in several
  pieces, but presented her with the pieces. One time I invited my
  friends to my own birthday party, and poor Mama didn't know about
  it, but she carried on and I had a few girls over. (This is
  rather hazy.) I liked my first grade teacher, Miss Bellington,
  but one thing I'll never forget. I had a seat that squeaked and
  she had me stand in front of the room for a few minutes. It
  seemed like hours and I almost died. Still when I sat down the
  seat squeaked again, and I was so humiliated and scared. She
  must have realized that I couldn't help it, so she got the
  janitor to come and oil it. A very traumatic experience for a
  six year old.</p>

  <p>At Minneota once I almost drowned. Newell and a friend
  (Alfred Anderson I think) were fishing with bent pins for hooks,
  and I was wading nearby. The little river was swollen with
  spring rains. A man came by and warned me about going too far,
  but that was a challenge. I did go too far and stepped into the
  drop-off. The only thing that saved me was a clump of grass that
  I saw and grabbed and pulled myself up. The boys didn't realize
  that I was in trouble, and laughed. They ran with me to
  Grandma's house though, where I got some dry clothes. I was
  entirely soaked from head to foot.</p>

  <p>One time at Grandma's place I was trying to catch one of her
  little turkeys. I ran after them and accidentally stepped on one
  and killed it. I was so scared that I told Grandma that it was
  squeezed to death in a crack in some boards (a likely story).
  Well, nothing happened, but later (months later) my conscience
  bothered me so much that I told Mama and asked forgiveness for
  telling a lie. She was very understanding and said Grandma knew
  that I had killed the turkey, and that she was glad that I had
  confessed.</p>

  <p>While we were still in Minneota we visited our grandparents
  Lee in Coleman, South Dakota. I think we went by train and
  Grandpa and Uncle met us at the station with horses. It was a
  cold clear night with a beautiful blue sky full of stars.
  Grandma Lee had food ready for us, Rrooma Grrot for one thing,
  but I was so tired I threw myself on the bed and no one could get

  me to move. The next day Clara and I played with our cousin,

  whose name was Thelma Clara Irene Leeland. I think we stayed

  there a couple of days. Another time we went to Coleman for

  Uncle Ingulf's wedding. Mama changed our dresses in the woods

  because there were so many people in the house. When pictures

  were taken, Clara and I were in the front row, having squeezed
  ourselves forward so we could see what was going on. (This
  picture is in the old trunk that I have).</p>

  <p>We had a sister named Gladys Miranda born after Clara, but
  she died of "summer complaint" when she was nine months old. I
  remember when she died, also seeing her in her little coffin with
  a flower in her hand.</p>

  <p>Papa had wanted to go to Georgia when his brother Haagen

  went, but the Orsens wouldn't let Mama go. Then he wanted to
  teach school and farm, and he had an opportunity to do that at
  Fox. Before Papa married, he had gone a year at Valparaiso

  Lutheran University, but couldn't go the next fall because he was
  ill (with scarlet fever?).</p>

  <p>He taught school in the country near Minneota at least one

  year. Mama was one of his students for a while. He was elevator
  man in Minneota for years.</p>

  <p>That summer in 1909, Papa went first and found a log cabin
  not too far from the schoolhouse. Also some acreage. Then he
  sent for us. We were (in age) Newell, I, Clara, Lillian and
  Theresa, and then Aunt Nora (Mama's youngest sister), fourteen
  years at the time, went along to help with the kids, but it

  actually meant one more kid for Mama to look after. She had six
  instead of five. We had to change trains at Fargo and also
  stayed overnight there. Everything went 0.x. I know I had no
  worries and the others didn't either. It was Mama who carried

  the burden, and was she ever glad to see Papa at the station in
  Fox. We were too of course, and thrilled with everything we saw.
  Papa was my teacher from second grade to high school.</p>

  <p>Papa had a huge dog named Caesar in Minneota. He liked the
  dog, and on the ice the fellows could take a hold of his tail and
  the dog would pull them over the ice. Papa brought him along to
  Fox, but had to get rid of him because everyone was afraid of
  him. Just wagging his tail and touching Theresa would knock her
  down. His bark was worse than his bite. Papa hated to let him
  go. A Scotch Collie was sent to us from Minneota and he came by
  train. He was so angry at the train that he chased it every
  time. We locked him in the entry when the train went by whenever
  we could. After the first snowfall the plows were on the train
  engine and the poor Collie was cut down. We all cried when we
  came home from school and Mama told us what had happened.</p>

  <p>I was strong and liked to wrestle with Newell and the other
  boys. When Papa found out about it there was no more wrestling
  for me. I climbed telephone poles too a few times. We had a lot
  of fun playing in those lovely sand piles and also on the swings

  that Papa put up for us in the oak trees. I also snared rabbits
  with Newell in winter. He tried to get me to shoot with his .22
  when he got that. (I think that was at Haug.) I tried once and

  under his coaching I hit the rabbit. That's the first and last
  time I ever shot a gun.</p>

  <p>Let us not forget our religious training. At Minneota we
  went regularly to Sunday school and church, but at Fox there was
  no Sunday school and no regular church services. We had Sunday

  school lessons every Sunday morning in our home at first, but
  then Papa started a Sunday school in the regular schoolhouse.
  The people were grateful and cooperated. He also led a choir and
  the choir sometimes practised in our home after we got the organ
  from Aunt Oline. She was Papa's sister who lived in Great Falls,
  Montana. (I still have the organ.) Church services were held irregularly in the schoolhouse. Preachers came around to the
  various communities from time to time.</p>

  <p>At Haug it was much the same. A Luther League was started
  and some programs were held in the schoolhouse. We played a lot
  of baseball at Haug at noon lunch hour and even at recess. Papa
  was teaching at Haug when the big drainage ditch was dug that
  went by the Haug schoolhouse. They must have dug from two
  directions because one dredge Opened into the other ditch one day
  while we were at school and Papa let us go out and look at it.
  Once at Haug I went to get the mail in the mail box about a half
  mile away. I rode the horse (Gary) because there was a thin
  sheet of ice on the water puddles and I knew there was quite a
  puddle surrounding tha mail box. It went fine till I got to the
  puddle and the horse would go no farther. He would not step
  through the ice. I got down and tried to keep hold of the bridle
  rein while I reached for the mail, but I couldn't so I dropped
  the rein, the horse galloped home and I was left in the ice. I
  got the mail, wet to my ankles and was hopping mad all the way
  home.</p>

  <p>From Haug we went to Halma. I was confirmed there by Pastor
  Gjerde. I had passed eighth grade at Halma by passing the State
  exams when I was thirteen, but I still continued to go to school
  for two years. And the next year I stayed home to help when
  Allan was born. From Halma we moved to Badger so we could all go
  to high school and still stay at home. Clara and I went through
  high school together. Clara was valedictorian and I was
  salutatorian when we graduated in 1922. Then we went to Normal
  school in Warroad for a year. We roomed with Roy and Myrtle
  Wammer, Ethelyn Rude, and Isabel Carlson. Miss McBroom was our
  instructor. I taught at Grimstad school two or three miles from
  Wannaska, and stayed with the A.P. Sunsets. (One room school,
  all grades.) I taught at Halma one year; I had upper grades and
  Clara the lower. Then I was at Haug two years. Papa had run for
  county auditor and lost. Mrs. Hans Haug was hired for the upper
  grades at Haug school and I took the lower grades. Since Papa
  had taken the bus route I naturally took that over. Papa took a
  one room country school that winter. It wasn't easy for any of
  us that winter. We had a lot of snow and at times it was hard to
  get through. I had to go north to get the Jensen boys and once I
  couldn't get the horses out of a snow drift. They just
  floundered and lay there. Finally an older Jensen came and
  helped me. The horses almost laid down again another time or
  two, but made a couple of jerks and got going again. Mama helped
  all she could, feeding hay and milking the cow. Her arms

  bothered her a lot too. Her hands and arms were numb at times.
  I think it was during that winter that she had trouble with the
  zipper on her overshoe, but maybe someone else remembers better.</p>

  <p>The next summer the folks moved back to Halma and I taught

  another year at Haug. I then stayed at Ole Holmes' and walked
  forth and back to school, almost two miles. The next year I went
  to Twin Valley and taught for one year. Next I taught at Beaton
  school near Halma. I drove the car in the fall and spring,
  staying with the folks. I stayed at Silnes' during the winter
  and walked to school and back. That year, on June 14, 1930 I
  married Torger Folland and lived happily ever after.</p>

  <p class="signature">&mdash;Thelma</p>

  <p>P.S. At Minneota while Papa was working in the elevator he came

  home one evening all bandaged up&mdash;face and arms. He had been in
  an elevator bin or some dark place and had a lantern that
  exploded when he got to the bottom. He managed to get out but
  was badly burned. He came riding on his bicycle. At Fox he
  chopped into his big toe when he was chopping wood. It became
  infected and he doctored with it all winter.</p>

  <h3><a name="letters--clara-annette-lee-prosser">CLARA ANNETTE LEE PROSSER</a></h3>
  <p>February, 1978</p>

  <p>I was born in Minneota on December 31, 1903. Newell liked
  to tease me saying my birthday almost slipped off the calendar.</p>

  <p>We had wonderful Christian parents. At Minneota Papa was
  superintendent of the Sunday school. He started one at Fox but
  had no chance to have one at Haug so we had it at home every
  Sunday morning. 'He was superintendent at Halma and Karlstad. At
  Halma he also started a band which played at summer picnics. He
  directed choirs at Fox, Haug and Halma. Mama was so full of love
  that she would reach out to everyone with some of it, especially
  to the older and younger ones. Someone said of her, "To know her
  is to love her." She was an active member in the Ladies' Aid
  wherever she lived. At one time at Halma she was very sick, and
  I remember Papa with tears in his eyes praying for her recovery.
  He asked if it were possible, then to spare her for us. He
  prayed in Norwegian.</p>

  <p>Our parents enjoyed fun. At Fox they told us that one day
  Grandpa and Grandma Orsen would come soon from Minneota by train

  for a visit. They told Newell, Thelma and me to go to the depot
  and practise standing, so we'd know where and how to stand when
  they came. That was the day they came and were we three ever

  surprised when they got off the train. At Haug once they told us
  we were to get company but wouldn't tell us who. We guessed many
  of our relatives. When Papa came from Badger he brought home a
  horse (and buggy) that he had bought.</p>

  <p>When Papa taught at Halma he also had the janitor job, and
  he paid Thelma and me to sweep out the two rooms, halls and
  steps. Mama was in charge of washing the floors there, with our
  help. At Fox I ran across a field chasing a skunk, calling
  "Kitty, kitty," but Papa saw me, called me back and gave me my
  first lesson on skunks. Thelma and I were in the woods one day
  and she had a long blue stick along. We didn't know what a
  wasp's nest was so she poked a hole in one with her pretty stick.
  They rushed out after us and I got stung on the bare legs so ran
  home crying. Thelma didn't get stung, but I remember thinking
  that she should have been.</p>

  <p>Thelma and I played basketball at Badger one year, with
  Newell as coach. We lived two miles west of Badger so drove with
  our horse Blossom. One winter there was so much snow that we
  tipped over with our cutter. Once our Badger team went to
  Greenbush in a school bus (with horses) and beat them twenty to
  zero.</p>

  <p>Thelma and I attended Normal school at Warroad in 1922-23.
  Four others from Badger attended and we rented an upstairs of
  three rooms and did our own cooking. Theresa and Lillian and two
  others attended there the following year and rented a small

  house, did their own cooking and even cut their own wood. (Ask
  Lillian about this.) The following spring Lillian stayed with

  Thelma and did her practice teaching and Theresa stayed with me.
  One year Thelma, Clara, Lillian, Theresa and Papa all taught
  school in Roseau County, and attended the Teachers' Institute at
  Roseau one fall. Miss McBroom, our Normal teacher, took a
  picture of us.</p>

  <p>Once at Minneota, Newell had some friends over and they must
  have played "cops and robbers." They locked me in the chicken
  house as I was their prisoner. I hunted all over in the straw
  etc. for a stick to push the latch up but couldn't find one.
  Besides, I couldn't have reached the latch anyway. So I just
  hollered and screamed. At lunch time Mama missed me so they came
  and let me out, but were thoroughly scolded because they had
  forgotten me.</p>

  <p>At Fox at five years I fell into the cellar, and cut my nose
  against a step. I heard them say, "Clara broke her nose!" I
  couldn't go to school for a while because my face was all swollen
  and discolored. I had a scar for many years.</p>

  <p>I can tell several mouse stories. At Hendricks where I
  taught for two years, I stayed overnight with a family. During
  the night I heard the rattling of paper in my big school package
  on the floor. A little later I felt the mouse in bed with me, so

  I threw off the quilts. Later I tried to sleep. Next morning
  while waiting for the school bus, I felt something in the pocket
  of my coat, and out jumped the mouse into the snow. At Badger
  Lillian was out skating and felt something in her stocking cap so
  she took it off and out jumped a mouse on the ice. No one knew
  where the mouse had come from except Lillian. The boys skated
  and chased it but Lillian went home and cried. At Greenbush
  Eunice at about twelve years sewed a plain dress and a mouse got
  into the drawer and nibbled holes in the front of it. The

  teacher helped put in a new front but Eunice would never wear
  that dress. At an apartment where Marilyn stayed when she taught
  in Golden Valley, there were many traces of mice. The girls left
  there when they found a dead mouse in the toaster.</p>

  <p>Mama drove the oxen to Ladies' Aid in Fox and took several
  women with her.</p>

  <p>Allan was born at home in Halma. Mama sent me to get Mrs.
  Kolden (about a mile away) to be the midwife. Sylvia was born at
  home in Badger and Mrs. Geror was the midwife. The doctor came
  later.</p>

  <p>The three older ones will remember more than I do, but I'll

  jot down a few things. I know we lived in a house in Minneota
  before we moved to Fox. Papa worked in an elevator there and
  also was a city policeman. I think he also played in the band,

  and for a time he played the violin for dances.</p>

  <p>The move to Fox came when he accepted the position as
  teacher of a one-room school (I think as many as sixty were on
  the roll!) The log house was there when we came. I was two and
  a half, Tess one year. It was the fall of 1909. It was from Fox
  that we went to the County Fair in Roseau by ox team. Haug was
  our next home&mdash;a two room school. I started school there. Next
  was Halma (Al born there) then Badger (Sylvia born there). Papa
  worked in an elevator in Badger until he bought the farm and an
  old school house which he tore down to build into a barn and
  house on the farm. He had carpenters to help. They built the
  barn first and we lived there until the house was built. Allan
  "helped" by pounding nails into the floor around the register
  which was between dining and living rooms. When the mortgage was
  foreclosed we moved to Haug again&mdash;then to Halma, then to
  Karlstad. Years??</p>

  <h3><a name="letters--theresa-oline-lee-dordal">THERESA OLINE LEE DORDAL</a></h3>
  <p>February, 1978</p>

  <p>Born October 14, 1908 in Minneota, Minnesota. Moved to Fox
  when I was a year old. All I remember of that place is what I
  have been told&mdash;of the dog and his tail, and Newell, Thelma and
  Clara carrying me around in a big pail, and going to Roseau Fair
  drawn by oxen. That's why I say "From Oxen to Oxon Hill" is the
  title of my life story.</p>

  <p>Things I remember from Haug are the cyclone that took the
  roof off the schoolhouse; the tramps that occasionally slept in
  the barn and had Mama scared; Papa coming home from summer
  school. Everyone used to tell their dreams but I never had any
  to tell, so I made up one about Papa coming home all covered with
  roses. I was laughed at so I didn't try that again.</p>

  <p>At Halma&mdash;Alice Holm had the mumps but wanted me to come
  and play with her. Mama said I could go but not to get too
  close. Of course we sat face to face in the swing&mdash;and I got
  the mumps. Slept with Lillian, but no one else got it. Lillian
  and I each had a pet cat. We dressed them up like real babies.
  Lillian always carried hers back down, and I always had mine back
  up. One Christmas two of Oliver Folland's boys got guns for
  gifts, and somehow our pets were missing. Later we found them
  shot. Such sorrow and anger! Clara must tell of her encounter
  with kitties in the woods&mdash;only they were striped ones.</p>

  <p>Our Fourth of July money came from trapping gophers and

  getting bounty money. Newell helped me so I had about forty
  cents to spend. I always got an orange and all the rest got
  bananas. After the baseball game on the fourth, Papa always

  bought us ice cream and cake at the church.</p>

  <p>Last summer in talking to Susan, she asked if I was the one
  Dad had made hold a big gander by the neck. I said indeed I was.
  How Newell laughed, and I hollered until Mama came to the rescue.
  Susan said that was her favorite bedtime story! I also remember
  how that same gander chased Clara around the house so fast she
  went by the door and had to run around twice.</p>

  <p>I remember how excited I was to learn Mama was to have a
  baby. I immediately ran to inform Papa of the good news. I also
  was so naive as to think the doctor brought Allan in his little
  black bag. But how happy I was not to be the baby any more.</p>

  <p>Miss Cora Head was my first grade teacher, and Barbara
  Rankin my second and third. When we moved to Badger I started
  sixth grade. Newell and I made the trip from Halma to Badger
  with a horse drawn hayrack full of our belongings that hadn't
  been auctioned off. I was wearing Clara's coat which was too
  long for me and when I tried to get off a stool at the drug store
  in Greenbush where we got a snack, I fell off and was so
  embarrassed! But I loved going with Newell who taught me all
  kinds of songs like "Sailing down the Henry Clay", and yodelling.</p>

  <p>We skated on a pond in Badger near our first house. Allan
  liked to open the door and run off so Papa put a hook up high.
  Al got the broom and pushed up the hook and got away. We lived
  in a small house until the new one on the farm was built, and
  that's where Sylvia was born. How tickled I was when I heard she
  was a girl. I said, "Now I'm not the baby girl any more." And
  Allan said, "That little kid can have my buggy, but she can't
  have my high chair though." Papa did get the 'flu, and had a
  serious relapse during the 'flu epidemic.</p>

  <p>To go back a bit&mdash;I remember when Mama was so sick we
  thought she was dying. We were all around her bed. Later when
  she was better she told of hearing heavenly music and light. She
  scalded her left arm and breast with boiling water when washing
  clothes, and had huge blisters for a long time. We kept cream,
  milk and butter in pails hanging in the well to keep cool and
  sweet. We took turns churning butter and had good buttermilk to
  drink. We picked wild strawberries, dewberries, sand cherries,
  high bush cranberries, blueberries, gooseberries, juneberries,
  chokecherries and hazel nuts. During harvest we picked potatoes
  for four cents a bushel (does that sound right?) Papa fixed some
  curved knives we used to weed the onions.</p>

  <p>Thelma mentioned the organ. How much enjoyment that gave
  all of us for many years! Papa bought an old schoolhouse and
  used the lumber to build the house and barn near Badger. Willard
  Olevson, Aunt Bea's brother, was a carpenter so he spent the
  summer there. Alfred and Annie Orsen, and Louis and Irene Orsen
  lived near us too. We went to school in horse drawn buses and
  once the driver was drunk and we made the two miles home in short

  order. At our school we couldn't dance and the teacher couldn't
  smoke.</p>

  <p>We had the book "Tess of the Storm Country" which my older
  sisters could read, but Mama wouldn't let me read it until I was
  sixteen. By that time I'd decided I'd never read it, so I never
  did. Of course we only had outdoor plumbing and no "White
  Cloud", but rolled and crumpled Sears and Roebuck pages.</p>

  <p>After being out on the farm I needed my tonsils and adenoids

  out so went to Roseau and Newell stayed with me. Dr. Delmore
  operated at nine one morning and sent me home on the noon train&mdash;losing blood out the window all the way! I spent the next two
  weeks in bed up in the barn. One wintry day Mama took me to see
  a calf being born. Quite an experience. Thelma and I were the
  milkmaids while Clara and Lillian did the inside work most of the
  time. We had seven cows&mdash;"Seven-spot" and "Littago" were two, I
  recall.</p>

  <p>Once a cat insisted on making romantic noises on the roof of

  the porch by our bedroom. Papa couldn't sleep and nothing made
  the cat leave until he took a good swig of liniment and spit it
  at the cat. That did it. Allan pumped kerosene into the coffee

  pot Mama left on the porch while she fed the chickens. He also
  painted red paint on his nice white crib. When Papa cut his foot

  with the axe he had to wrap it in heavy brown paper and bake it
  in the oven at six hundred degrees. He baked the infection out
  of it!</p>

  <p>After I graduated from high school in 1924 I worked on a

  farm for five dollars a week. Then at the Greenbush hospital
  where I witnessed a baby being born.</p>

  <p>Lillian, Lenorah Erickson, Selina Swenson and Minnie
  Wickstrom and I went to Warroad Normal Training under Myrtle
  McBroom. We lived in a small cottage and did all our cooking
  and heating, even to sawing and chopping wood. We did nothing

  but work and study.</p>

  <p>Then I taught in a seven-month rural one-room school for $75
  a month one year and $80 the next and spent $16 a month for room
  and board living with the Thompsons and sharing a bed with Thelma
  Thompson. Papa and four of his daughters all taught at the same
  time in the same county (Roseau.) His years at Fox he started at
  $25 a month&mdash;with sixty kids in one room.</p>

  <p>After a year at Moorhead S.T.C. I taught three years at

  Halstad, then eight years at Aitkin. In 1934 I went with three
  Aitkin teachers to Mexico City. Another summer I went west with
  four teachers to Oregon and California. Summer school at Cloud
  in 1935.</p>

  <p>Met Ray at Karlstad&mdash;set my cap for him and we were married
  June 18, 1939. We were blessed with three wonderful children and
  now have three grandchildren. I wish Ray could see them.</p>

  <h3><a name="letters--sylvia-eunice-lee-wuerffel">SYLVIA EUNICE LEE WUERFFEL</a></h3>
  <p>April 16, 1978</p>

  <p>Once upon a time there was a little girl who lived with her

  Papa and Mama, the best in the world, and with two sisters and
  four brothers, also the best in the world. Naturally, she was
  spoiled rotten!</p>

  <p>Sylvia was born in a little house in Badger, Minnesota, on
  December 18, 1919. Then we lived on the farm. I can vaguely
  remember Newell's scaring me with shaving lather all over his
  face and saying, "I'm the man with the hole in his face." I told
  him to go away, and he went! He went to Mankato and I didn't see
  him for a long long time. I thought that was my fault. We had
  two big white horses named King and Molly. One day when the mail
  came Mama sat down to read a letter and one of my toes got under

  the chair leg! Squash! I was four years old when we moved to
  the pink house at Haug. I liked living there. Aunt Oline came
  to visit and that was very special. We had a pretty little dog

  named Trixie and of course we always had cats which I loved.
  Allan, do you remember when you drove the Model T home from
  Jensens' when you were seven or eight, because one of the horses,
  Fanny or Blossom had run away and was over there. Papa rode the
  horse home and let you drive the car. Boy, was Mama ever upset!</p>

  <p>My first teacher's name was Miss Jewell Torkelson. The
  first year I did all of the first grade work and half of the
  second, along with Ruth Christianson, who was my best friend.
  The next year sister Thelma was my teacher and I finished all of
  the second grade work plus all of the third. 30 did Ruth. Papa
  taught the four upper grades and drove the school bus. One night
  coming home from school in the winter, the horses got scared and
  took off, tipping the bus over and getting away. We were all
  scared but not hurt. One boy's knee went right through the side
  of the bus. The horses ran over to Wolds, I think.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 1927 we moved to Halma where the whole
  family but me had lived before. We moved into a beautiful big
  white house owned by T.L. Spilde. Oh did I ever think that was a
  great place. Mama had a surprise birthday for me that year, when
  I was eight. I had a lot of friends to play with there. Papa
  made skis for Allan and me there too. He wired them and steamed
  them in the wash boiler to make them turn up at the ends and
  then waxed them. He helped us make a slide on the manure pile
  behind the barn and it really worked pretty well. We did some
  sliding down straw stacks too, especially with Joseph and
  Isabelle Spilde. Allan and I rode the bicycle to Jorgen
  Jacobson's to pick chokecherries, and we picked strawberries
  pincherries and juneberries with Mama and the girls.</p>

  <p>Sister Clara was my fourth grade teacher, and Ellen Sanner

  was my best friend. When I was in fifth grade I was in the Big

  Room where Papa had charge, but we went to the little room for

  history or reading and sister Lillian was my teacher. (I can't
  remember for sure just which subject or subjects she taught us.
  I suppose she remembers.)</p>

  <p>Papa was my teacher for the rest of fifth grade through
  eighth. I was a bit afraid of him and he was pretty strict and
  he thought I ought to know arithmetic better than I did. He was
  sure I had flunked the State Board in that subject (I think I had
  a 49 by his marking) but several weeks later I got my "passed"
  notice from the State and I'm sure he was as happy as I!</p>

  <p>We moved to Karlstad that summer, 1932. High school was
  quite an enjoyable time in my life. I studied hard and got good
  grades, but I also had fun singing in the glee club and taking
  part in four class plays and an Operetta, declamatory contests
  and debates. Ray Dordal was my teacher for three years and my
  debate coach. Everyone liked him. Little did I know that later
  he would be my brother-in-law, because at that time he had not
  even met Theresa!</p>

  <p>Allan had stayed home for a year after eighth grade, taking
  a couple of high school subjects from Papa along with Lawrence
  Spilde. Then he went to Crookston A.C. for a year. So he was a
  year ahead of me at Karlstad.</p>

  <p>Allan graduated in 1935 and I in 1936. Allan, I'm sure you
  went to work for Archie Lee in 1935, because you were in Roseau
  when I was a senior. We lived in three different houses in
  Karlstad, the last one being the one Papa bought with money Aunt
  Oline left him when she died. I went out to Thelma and Torger's
  the summer of 1936 as I had done in 1933 when Anita was a baby.
  I thought it was so great to have nieces and nephews&mdash;and I
  still do! I was so glad Thelma and Clara and Newell lived close
  enough to visit often. Newell and Lil took me to see my first
  circus. Absolutely fantastic, and I'll never forget that.</p>

  <p>In October of 1936 I went to Interstate Business College in
  Fargo. I believe it was in January of 1937 that Allan came there
  too and took some bookkeeping courses. I don't remember how long
  he was there but it was only a couple of months. We had some
  good times skating on the Red River and tobogganing on man made
  slides nearby. I wasn't thrilled with Business College, but I
  guess it was well worth my while. Ha. I came home for the
  summer of 1937 (which was not a smart move) and then back again
  in September.</p>

  <p>Then on December 21, 1937, Mama died! After that I stayed

  at home and kept house for Papa. My, how patient he was, and
  never complained about how I did things. He taught me how to
  make boiled coffee! Ha.</p>

  <p>In June of 1939 Tess and Ray were married and lived with
  Papa. I went to Roseau to keep house for Maureen Mitchell and
  take care of her two children. In November I came home, did a
  little visiting and gave Arlys Folland the mumps. I had a bad
  case myself. In January, 1940, I started work for Lena Brendal

  in the Kittson County Welfare Office in Hallock, Minnesota.
  Twenty two months later (in October, 1941) I moved across the
  hall to the Farm Security Office for three or four months, and
  then with the same office I moved to McIntosh, Minnesota. In May
  of 1943 I took a leave of absence to help Lillian and Elmer take
  care of Papa who was sick with stomach cancer. He died in August
  (the sixth), 1943. At that time Tess and Ray were living in
  Minneapolis and I went there and got a job with Northern States
  Power Co. Ray had gone into the service. In May of 1944 Tess
  went to Washington, D.C. to join Ray, and cousin Maxine Miller
  and I tagged along. Ray was soon sent to Hawaii so Maxine,
  Adeline Dordal, Tess and I lived together in an apartment.</p>

  <p>I met Herman Leonard Wuerffel at the Lutheran Church of the
  Reformation on Capitol Hill where we all sang in the Reformation
  Singers' Choir. We were married in 1946. We have three children
  and expect our first grandchild in August 1978.</p>

  <p>We moved to New Jersey in 1955 where Herm has worked for
  RCA.</p>

  <p class="separation">------</p>

  <p>One day when we lived in the big white house in Halma, when
  I was perhaps nine or ten, a magazine salesman came to the door.</p>

  <p>Mama said no, she didn't want any. I remember being terribly
  angry at his reply, which he didn't say loud enough for her to
  hear: "Well, I hope when I get to be a doctor you'll be my

  patient and I'll give you a bum pill." She laughed when I told
  her, but I didn't think it was funny at all.</p>

  <p>In March 1934 I got an acute attack of appendicitis after
  having the 'flu. Newell came and got me and took me to Roseau to
  have my operation. Mama stayed a couple of days too, I believe.
  I was in the hospital for nine days and then I went to Newell and
  Lil's for a couple of days before they took me home again.</p>

  <p>Allan, the first year we lived in Karlstad, Ray taught
  eighth grade, or I guess it was seven and eight. Then when I was
  a sophomore and you a junior he became Principal of the high
  school. So you had him for two years and I for three.</p>

  <p>A lot has happened to the Lee family since Dad finished
  writing this history. Many of the family members mentioned
  have died, and new generations have been added. The family
  continues to grow. We have spread throughout the United States, and even beyond.</p>

  <p>Dad died in 1985. His sister, Lillian Heide, died this
  past year. These events helped me to appreciate Dad's
  writing all the more. He has preserved a piece of our
  family history that otherwise might be forgotten with time</p>

  <p>We knew that Dad wanted his children, grandchildren and
  relatives to have a chance to "remember" the past. That is
  why he wrote the history. I'm only sorry that it took so long to make his efforts available.</p>

  <p>I would like to thank my husband, John Barlow, for all
  his help with this project. Without his encouragement,
  assistance, and knowledge of word-processing, it would still be just an unedited manuscript in a big envelope.</p>

  <p>I would also like to express my appreciation for the
  letters written by Newell, Thelma, Clara, Lillian, Theresa,
  and Sylvia. I didn't ask if I could use them in this way,
  and I only hope the presumption that no one would mind is
  forgiven. They have been printed unedited. These letters
  are as much a part of this history as Dad's writing. This
  project wouldn't be complete without them.
